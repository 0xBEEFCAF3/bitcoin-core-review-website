## Notes

See notes from the [first review club](/25038).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
What was your review approach?

### Concept

1. If we were running a business that accepted unconfirmed transactions as payments, what changes should we make so that our wallet correctly tracks v3 transactions?

1. Who might be interested in using v3 transactions? Who probably wouldn't be interested?

1. If there are some wallets/users/applications that use v3 while others don't, is there a privacy issue (i.e. people
   can fingerprint which wallet likely created a transaction by looking at its version)?

1. After the addition of v3, all non-v3 transactions are still subject to the existing limitations and pinning attacks.
   Wouldn't it be safer to enforce these rules for all transactions on the network?

1. V3 limits each transaction to 1 parent or 1 child (2 generations only), and perhaps that seems
   restrictive. Let's consider an alternative set of rules that allows each transaction to have 2
parents or 2 children (a transaction may have up to 2 children or up to 2 parents. They cannot have
both an unconfirmed parent and an unconfirmed child, so 2 generations only) - what would be the
maximum cluster size?

1. Why not limit the size of all v3 transactions to 1,000vB or something similarly small (Hint: what property of LN
   channels depends on standard transaction
[weight](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/d975de1ba5d3e8aca586154ae0cae8f1b3181495/05-onchain.md#penalty-transactions-weight-calculation))?

### Implementation

1. Why does `ApplyV3Rules` [check](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/44fcc4d3912e21b055c377549c8882c67dddf278#diff-a19c07329799a164e1e3bd89e7cd07f1a8e5e97b88f2b24c9bef17df04479c74R96-R101) whether the transaction conflicts with any of its ancestors' children? What happens if you remove this check?

1. V3 ancestor/descendant limits are stricter than the default mempool limits. Do we need to call both
   [`ApplyV3Rules`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/a74218d1571de5880ba7e0c168571f560d12d166#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98R923)
(which enforces v3 ancestor/descendant limits) *and*
[`CalculateMemPoolAncestors()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/a74218d1571de5880ba7e0c168571f560d12d166#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98L878)
(which enforces ancestor/descendant limits)? Why or why not?

1. V3 rules are added to the [filtering function](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/a74218d1571de5880ba7e0c168571f560d12d166#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98R353-R358) passed to `removeForReorg()` in `Chainstate::MaybeUpdateMempoolForReorg`.
Why do we need to check v3 rules in a reorg?

1. Is `CTxMemPool::removeForReorg()` the appropriate place for this check? Can you think of an alternative place to add this check?

1. How does
   [`CheckMinerScores`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/58e811ecb1e1977422ecda2af62460e8efc057be) determine whether one transaction or package is more incentive compatible to mine than another? Is this function 100% accurate for v3 transactions? What about for non-v3 transactions?

1. Why is it necessary to [evict all transactions below minimum relay feerate](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/898847e1907eda3d87d19ea43099b71d9eded5f4) in `TrimToSize()`? (Hint: what does [this test](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/3db3e45497ee6932f225b7a2025c2bfba5cfaa23#diff-15a1888c9151fc1d182c23e34b71d691f70df448bceb9eb78c8296f18854b6a3R216) check)?

1. Why must `PackageMempoolChecks` [never be called with only 1 transaction](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/94c15f5e59413c6dbcedda1409f70a3f2bf211ac)? (Hint: an explanation can be found in [this commit](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/27881f0d824d4dae11e5587ae4a2511a04e30c0e)).

### Rabbit Holes

1. V3 restrictions suck! Why can't we just replace RBF Rules 3 and 4 with a *better* rule based on feerate? For example, "replacement tx must have a feerate 2x higher than each of the transactions it's replacing."

1. Why not allow packages with multiple parents and 1 child in v3?

1. Theoretically, if the mempool is not full, the maximum number of transactions that may be removed in a replacement is 100 (due to Rule 5). After [this commit](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/898847e1907eda3d87d19ea43099b71d9eded5f4), what is the new limit?

Also feel free to bring your own questions.
