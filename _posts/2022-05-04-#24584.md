## Notes

* A bitcoin transaction will often have a payment output and a change output. In order to preserve transaction privacy and avoid leaking information about a user's wallet and funds, we want to keep the payment address and payment amount as private as possible. In other words, we don't want to leak information which allows an outside observer to guess which of the two outputs is the payment vs the change.

* One technique used for determining the payment address and amount is the ["Payment to different script type"](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Sending_to_a_different_script_type) heuristic. This allows an outside observer to guess the payment address and amount with reasonable accuracy for certain types of bitcoin transactions.

* [PR #23789](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23789) added payment address matching when generating a change address as a means of breaking the heuristic. This logic can lead to the wallet having UTXOs of different address types (e.g bech32m, bech32, P2SH, legacy). Depending on how these UTXOs are spent in the future, they might still leak information about which is the change/payment address in the original transaction.

* This PR adds logic to avoid mixing different address types when selecting UTXOs to fund a transaction

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
2. In your own words, what is the "Payment to different script type" heuristic? How does it work?
3. What are [`OutputTypes`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/be7a5f2fc400e7a3ef72dedbdcf49dd6c96d4f9e/src/outputtype.h#L18) and [`TxoutTypes`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/be7a5f2fc400e7a3ef72dedbdcf49dd6c96d4f9e/src/script/standard.h#L59)? How are they different?
4. How can spending mixed `OutputType`s in a later transaction reveal information about the first transaction?
5. How do we pick the "best" `SelectionResult`? (HINT: what is the ["waste metric"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/be7a5f2fc400e7a3ef72dedbdcf49dd6c96d4f9e/src/wallet/coinselection.cpp#L374))
6. Are there other things besides waste that we could consider when funding a transaction?
7. We run over each `OutputType` in [`AttemptSelection`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24584/files#diff-6e06b309cd494ef5da4e78aa0929a980767edd12342137f268b9219167064d13R433-R448), but are there other places we could have applied the "no mixing" logic?
8. C++ trivia: what is the ["erase/remove"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24584/commits/68d96078714c1ed1804c293a2f05c3fb33092efa#diff-6e06b309cd494ef5da4e78aa0929a980767edd12342137f268b9219167064d13R551-R557) idiom? Why is it preferred over other methods of removing elements from a container?
