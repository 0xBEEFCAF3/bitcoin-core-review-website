[Compact block filters](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/compact-block-filters/) (not to be confused with [compact blocks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki)) were introduced in [BIP 158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki) as a more privacy-friendly and incentive-compatible alternative to Bloom filters.

The main purpose of this PR is to improve performance when loading filters from disk by bypassing unnecessarily expensive checks. To verify this, the authors (#24832 builds on the work done in [#19280](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19280)) also introduced new benchmark tests. Benchmarks are located in `/src/bench`, and you can also read the [usage instructions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/benchmarking.md) on how to compile and run the benchmarks.

Once you've compiled `bench_bitcoin`, you can run the entire benchmark test suite, or just limit your tests to the tests related to this PR by using the `filter` option:

```sh
./bench_bitcoin --filter="GCS.*"
```

## Notes

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. When are compact block filters actually loaded from disk? Is this a frequent process?

3. This PR introduces a new `skip_decode_check` bool parameter in the [`GCSFilter` constructor](https://github.com/kcalvinalvin/bitcoin/blob/e734228d8585c0870c71ce8ba8c037f8cf8b249a/src/blockfilter.h#L62) that controls whether we check the size of the filter. In which scenarios will this parameter actually be `true`? Could we remove it?

4. We usually don't pass `(u)int` type variables by reference. Why is that different for the `const uint256& hash` parameter in [`BlockFilterIndex::ReadFilterFromDisk`](https://github.com/kcalvinalvin/bitcoin/blob/e734228d8585c0870c71ce8ba8c037f8cf8b249a/src/index/blockfilterindex.h#L34)?

5. In [`GCSFilterDecodeSkipCheck()`](https://github.com/kcalvinalvin/bitcoin/blob/e734228d8585c0870c71ce8ba8c037f8cf8b249a/src/bench/gcs_filter.cpp#L62-L72), is it reasonable to construct `GCSFilter filter` with {0, 0} as the first two of the `Params` arguments? In your own words, what do the 4 `Params` parameters represent?

6. Were you able to compile the `bench_bitcoin` benchmark tool?

7. Were you able to run the benchmarks? In terms of `ns/op` (nanoseconds per operation), what are the results are you getting for `GCSFilterDecode` and for `GCSFilterDecodeSkipCheck`? Is that in line with expectations, and would you say there is sufficient benefit to warrant merging this PR?

8. What are the risks and downsides of this PR? Are there any new attack vectors?
