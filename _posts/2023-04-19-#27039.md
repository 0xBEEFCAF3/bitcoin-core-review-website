## Notes

- Recommended reading from earlier review clubs:
  - [17994: Flush undo files after last block write](/17994) to learn more about how blocks are downloaded and stored
  - [16981: Improve runtime performance of --reindex](/16981) and [24858: incorrect blk file size calculation during reindex results in recoverable blk file corruption](/24858) to learn more about reindexing

- The `blocks/` directory contains three datasets:
  - the raw append-only `blknnnnn.dat` files containing the serialized block data
  - the raw append-only `revnnnnn.dat` files containing the [undo data](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/117887/why-undo-files-are-needed-in-the-bitcoin-core),
  - the `blocks/index/` block index data which is stored in a LevelDB database. The index helps to quickly find blocks without having to re-scan all the data files.
    - At runtime, the block index is loaded into [`BlockManager::m_block_index`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/19764dc143281376ea08e954018479ed10405b72/src/node/blockstorage.h#L152). However, we also maintain statistics about the block files in [`BlockManager::m_blockfile_info`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/19764dc143281376ea08e954018479ed10405b72/src/node/blockstorage.h#L117).

- Flushing is the process of bringing the data that we keep in-memory in sync with the data we store on disk. We want to flush regularly enough to ensure that when bitcoind is unexpectedly killed, we may have to redo some work (e.g. re-download a couple of blocks) but we don't end up in an unrecoverable state (that would e.g. require a completely new IBD). On the other hand, the (generally quite slow) disk I/O can have negative performance implications when we flush too often.

- A reindex, amongst other things, recreates the block index from the block files on disk. The block files themselves don't need to be updated: blocks are already assumed to not be stored sequentially in or across block files anyway.

- This PR skips flushing to disk blocks whose positions are already known. Skipping this means that users can write-protect the blk files on disk which may be useful for security or even safely sharing that data between multiple bitcoind instances.

- Some of the functions that are relevant to the reindexing process behave differently than can perhaps be expected from their name:
  - [`BlockManager::SaveBlockToDisk()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/19764dc143281376ea08e954018479ed10405b72/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L820) does not actually write anything to disk when (as is the case for a reindex) the known block position is passed (as `dbp`), but we still need to call it to update the blockfile info stats
  - [`BlockManager::FindBlockPos()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/19764dc143281376ea08e954018479ed10405b72/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L611) is mostly used to find the position in a blockfile where a new block is going to be appended. However, it also updates the blockfile info and may also trigger the flushing of block and undo files, which is why we still call it even if we already know the block's position.
  - this behaviour arguably could arguably be improved upon, as for example done in [this WIP by mzumsande](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...mzumsande:bitcoin:202207_refactor_findblockpos)


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. After this PR, can the whole `blocks/` directory be made read-only? Why (not)?

1. In [`FindBlockPos()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/19764dc143281376ea08e954018479ed10405b72/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L611), what is the relevance of `fKnown` to this PR, conceptually? How does the behaviour of `FindBlockPos()` change when `fKnown==true` instead of `false`?

1. What happens if bitcoind is killed after when block(s) have been processed, but before `FlushBlockFile()` is called? Does this PR affect that behaviour?

1. In the `blockmanager_flush_block_file` unit test, why are we [pausing](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/470ef396b5498d8689802c359a216d5a3c4749a5#diff-d6d633592a40f5f3d8b03863e41547de8751b874c1d20f129a616b9dd719b999R170) before starting a new blockfile? Can you think of issues with this approach, or alternatives?

1. In the `blockmanager_flush_block_file` unit test, why do we still [only have two blocks](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/470ef396b5498d8689802c359a216d5a3c4749a5/src/test/blockmanager_tests.cpp#L153-L154) in the file after we have called `SaveBlockToDisk(block3)`?

1. In [`BlockManager::FlushBlockFile()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/93c70287a6434c6c665a211dc4dfbbd9c3db4083/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L558), why do we always flush the undo file *except* for when we're finalizing the block file (and we're not finalizing the undo file)?
