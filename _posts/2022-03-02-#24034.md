## Notes

* [PR #17428](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428) adds "anchors" to help prevent an
  eclipse attack where an attacker tricks a restarting node into connecting to adversarial peers.
It saves block-relay-only connections to an anchors.dat file. When a node restarts, it tries to
connect to the addresses from anchors.dat. We discussed this PR in a [previous review club
meeting](/17428).

* Currently, anchors.dat is deleted right after it is read. However, if a node shuts down before
  trying to connect to that anchor peers, it will create an empty anchors.dat. Thus, an attacker
could make a node shut down before it tries to connect to those peers, thereby clearing their
anchors.dat and making the node connect to new peers (possible malicious ones) when starting again.

* PR #24034 changes the behavior so that anchors.dat is only deleted after the node has tried to
  connect to the peers from it. So, if a node stops before trying to connect to anchor peers, the
anchors.dat file will be preserved. Also, it avoids calling `DumpAnchors` if not all anchors.dat
peers have not been tried.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. What is an eclipse attack and how does [#17428](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17428)
   help prevent it?

1. Why do we delete anchors.dat? Why not just read and write?

1. There are two ways to shutdown a node: a "clean" way and "unclean" one. What does that mean?

1. On current master, what happens if we shut down (cleanly or uncleanly) before the node has tried
   to connect to the peers from anchors.dat?

1. In this PR, in which scenarios do we delete anchors.dat?

1. Avoiding deletion of anchors.dat file before trying to connect to all peers from it is not enough
   to preserve it in a clean shutdown. Why? How does the PR deal with this?
