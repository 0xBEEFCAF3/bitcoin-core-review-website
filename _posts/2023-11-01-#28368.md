## Notes

* The [`CBlockPolicyEstimator`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/policy/fees.h#L146C13-L146C13) is used to estimate what feerate a user should place on their transaction to be confirmed within a targeted number of blocks. RPCs [`estimaterawfees`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/rpc/fees.cpp#L100) and [`estimatesmartfees`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/rpc/fees.cpp#L29) can be used to obtain a feerate estimate for a given confirmation target. Fee estimation is also heavily used in the [wallet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/wallet/fees.cpp#L29).

* Before this PR, [`CTxMempool`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/22fa1f4702e9a60e141f545f8d09704deca34b22/src/txmempool.h#L301) owns a [`CBlockPolicyEstimator`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/policy/fees.h#L146C13-L146C13) as one of its members and, whenever a transaction is added or removed from the mempool in [`addUnchecked`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/txmempool.h#L475), [`removedUnchecked`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/txmempool.h#L787) and  [`removeForBlock`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/txmempool.h#L487) methods, it also updates the fee estimator synchronously.
 
* `removeForBlock` calls [`CBlockPolicyEstimator::processBlock`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/106ab20f121f14d021725c8a657999079dbabfc1/src/policy/fees.h#L204C11-L204C11) to update the fee stats when transactions are removed from the mempool after a new block connection.

* Since `removeForBlock` is part of a series of function calls within [`ConnectTip`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/validation.h#L732C13-L732C13), block processing is blocked by fee estimator updates. Adding more steps to `CBlockPolicyEstimator::processBlock` can slow down block processing even further.

 *  `CValidationInterface` includes validation-related events such as addition of a transaction to the mempool [`TransactionAddedToMempool`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/validationinterface.h#L99), the removal of a transaction from the mempool [`TransactionRemovedFromMempool`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/validationinterface.h#L133), the connection of a block to the chain [`BlockConnected`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/validationinterface.h#L140), and others.

    * Subclasses of [`CValidationInterface`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9c30f5ef9d6712539cb8dc0f52b3a2206a25e074/src/validationinterface.h#L77) are called subscribers or clients of `CValidationInterface`. They can implement the callbacks they need and must register with [`CMainSignals`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9c30f5ef9d6712539cb8dc0f52b3a2206a25e074/src/validationinterface.h#L182C7-L182C19) using [`RegisterValidationInterface`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9c30f5ef9d6712539cb8dc0f52b3a2206a25e074/src/validationinterface.h#L26).
    Validation and mempool use [`CMainSignals`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/9c30f5ef9d6712539cb8dc0f52b3a2206a25e074/src/validationinterface.h#L182C7-L182C19) to "notify" subscribers of these events.

    * Depending on the event, the callbacks may be executed immediately or added to a queue of callbacks to be executed asynchronously on a different thread.

* PR [#28368](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28368) removes `CTxMempool`'s' dependency on `CBlockPolicyEstimator` by making `CBlockPolicyEstimator` a client of `CValidationInterface`, instead of an internal component of `CTxMemPool`.

  * The PR makes `CBlockPolicyEstimator` update asynchronously in response to `CValidationInterface` events, which means updating the fee estimator no longer blocks block processing.

  * The PR also adds a new `CValidationInterface` callback `MempoolTransactionsRemovedForConnectedBlock` which is fired in [`removeForBlock`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/txmempool.h#L487).

  * The PR also modifies the `TransactionAddedToMempool` callback parameter from [`CTransactionRef`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ab2f531b785c3c17746ac9766a6db5b6d26677e8/src/primitives/transaction.h#L421) to a new struct `NewMempoolTransactionInfo` which has `CTransactionRef` and other information the fee estimator needs such as the virtual size and fees.

* There has been an attempt at this PR [#11775](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11775)

## Questions

### Conceptual

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

2. Why is it beneficial to remove `CTxMempool` dependency on `CBlockPolicyEstimator`?

3. Are there any benefits of the `CBlockPolicyEstimator` being a member of `CTxMempool`? Are there downsides to removing it?

4. The first attempt [#11775](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11775) split the `CValidationInterface` into `CValidationInterface` and `MempoolInterface`. What is the distinction between the two interfaces?

5. What do you think is better or worse about the approach taken in this approach, versus the one taken in [#11775](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11775) split the `CValidationInterface`?

6. Can you list the other subscribers to `CValidationInterface`?

7. Why is implementing a `CValidationInterface` method equivalent to "subscribing to the event"?

8. `BlockConnected` and `NewPoWValidBlock` are different callbacks. Which one is asynchronous and which one is synchronous? How can you tell?

### Code Review

{:start="9"}

9. In [`4986edb`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/4986edb99f8aa73f72e87f3bdc09387c3e516197), why are we adding a new callback `MempoolTransactionsRemovedForConnectedBlock` instead of using `BlockConnected`?

10. In [`1d116df`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/1d116df4c0e021c4c810450e3e5358f34d72940b), is `kernel/mempool_entry.h` the right place for `NewMempoolTransactionInfo`? What members are included in this struct, and why are they necessary?

11. Why can't we use a `std::vector<CTxMempoolEntry>` as a parameter of `MempoolTransactionsRemovedForBlock` callback?

12. How can you get the base fee of a `CTransactionRef`?

13. In [`ab4e250`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/ab4e250d1d209e0c79dba266461e6b0cfd670452#diff-c065d4cd2398ad0dbcef393c5dfc53f465bf44723348892395fffd2fb3bac522), is moving `removeTx` call to reason != `BLOCK` scope necessary? Is it fixing a bug?

14. Why is the fee estimator not tracking transactions with unconfirmed parents?

15. In [`79bcc5c`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/79bcc5ca0679daf6e57fc4d7ce2244262a7cfd13/src/txmempool.cpp#L641), we pass a copy of transaction `parents`, `nSizeWithAncestors`, and `nModFeesWithAncestors` to `NewMempoolTransactionInfo`. Is there a better approach to get all that information?

16. In [`79bcc5c`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/79bcc5ca0679daf6e57fc4d7ce2244262a7cfd13), why are the block transactions and their ancestors not removed from the mempool in the [first loop](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/79bcc5ca0679daf6e57fc4d7ce2244262a7cfd13/src/txmempool.cpp#L635) of `removeForBlock`?
