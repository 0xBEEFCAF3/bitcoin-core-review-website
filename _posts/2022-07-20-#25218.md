## Notes

- To simplify error handling in the [call site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_site), functions in Bitcoin Core quite often return a boolean to indicate if the operation was successful. One or multiple [out-parameters](http://www.cs.ecu.edu/karl/2530/spr18/Notes/lec21A.html#logical-calling-modes:~:text=an%20implicit%20one.-,Logical%20calling%20modes,-Call%20by%20value) can then be used to access the function result and information about the operation (e.g. error messages).

- To put it in (pseudo)code, you'll find many functions that look somewhat like this:
```cpp
bool doSomething(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, &result_obj, &error_string) {
    // do something...
    if (error) {
        error_string = "something bad happened";
        return false;
    }

    result = goodResult;
    return true;
}
```

- Using out-parameters is not always encouraged because they can be confusing or harder to read. Intuitively, parameters represent the *input* to a function and the return value represents the *output*.

- In #25218, a new `BResult` utility class is introduced that can be used to simplify function signatures by removing dependencies on out-parameters, while keeping it easy for call sites to verify that the called function returned successfully.

- `BResult` internally uses the private [`std::variant`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant) member [`std::variant<bilingual_str, T> m_variant`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/111ea3ab711414236f8678566a7884d48619b2d8/src/util/result.h#L18) which allows different types to reside in a single memory space. In practice, this `m_variant` stores either the result object of type `T`, or the error string of type `bilingual_str`.

- Using `BResult`, the previous pseudo code can now be simplified to:
```cpp
BResult<Obj> doSomething(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4) {
    // do something...
    if (error) return "something bad happened";

    return goodResult;
}
```

- Taking advantage of this new `BResult` class for existing code requires both the function as well all of its call sites to be refactored.
  
- The result of the kind of code simplification enabled by #25218 is quite visible in e.g. [`CWallet::GetNewDestination`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25218/files#diff-1f2db0e4d5c12d109c7f0962333c245b49b696cb39ff432da048e9d6c08944d8L2310-L2327), where both the actual result as well as the error string are no longer out-parameters.


## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What are the different types of parameters and return values that the PR assumes we commonly use in a function signature? Which of these parameters are affected by the PR?

3. Why does [`BResult`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/111ea3ab711414236f8678566a7884d48619b2d8/src/util/result.h#L16) have a separate constructor `BResult(const bilingual_str& error)` that seems to do the exact same as the templated constructor `BResult(const T& _obj)`? Does this introduce any edge cases or limitations, and if so - are they documented?

4. Do you know of any other commonly used return type(s) in the codebase that are similar to `BResult`?

5. In commit `wallet: refactor, include 'FeeCalculation' inside 'CreatedTransactionResult'`, what do you think is the rationale for making `FeeCalculation` a member of `CreatedTransactionResult` instead of having it as an out-parameter in `CreateTransaction()`?

6. Should someone now follow up with a big PR that refactors all functions that would benefit from using `BResult`? Why (not)?

7. (Bonus) Do you know of any other functions that you think would benefit nicely from being refactored to use `BResult`?
