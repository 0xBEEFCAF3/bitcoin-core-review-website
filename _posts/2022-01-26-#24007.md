## Notes

* The content of a transaction can be separated into two components:
  - non-witness data
  - witness data

* Since Segwit activation, there are two ways a transaction can be serialized,
  with and without the witness data.

* A transaction's `txid` is the sha256d hash of its non-witness serialization.

* A transaction's `wtxid` is the sha256d hash of its full (including its witness)
  serialization.
  (Hashing the serialization of only the witness data isn't useful.)

* It's possible for two transactions to have the same `txid` but different
  `wtxid`s. The opposite is not possible (same `wtxid`s but different `txid`s).
  That is, the mapping from `txid` to `wtxid` is one-to-many.

* The only place any type of transaction ID appears
  on the blockchain is within transaction inputs, each of which contains,
  among other things, a
  [`COutPoint`](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_c_out_point.html).
  This object "points" to an output of the source transaction using the
  `txid` (note, not `wtxid`) of the source transaction and the index
  into its outputs array. This is the output that this input is "spending".

* Currently, when a transaction is submitted to the mempool and an
  existing mempool transaction has the same `txid`, the incoming
  transaction is immediately rejected.

* Replace-by-fee (RBF), as described in
  [BIP125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki),
  allows transactions that have already been accepted into the mempool to
  be replaced by a newly-arriving transaction. Previous to BIP125, an
  incoming transaction that spent any of the same outputs as an existing
  in-mempool transaction would be rejected as a double-spend attempt.
  This has been called the "first seen safe" policy.

* If an RBF replacement does occur, any descendant (downstream) transactions
  in the mempool must be removed. These are transactions that (recursively)
  spend outputs of the transaction being replaced.

* The replacement transaction can spend different inputs (except at least
  one, or else it wouldn't conflict and replacement wouldn't be needed),
  can have different outputs, and therefore will always have a different
  `txid` than the transaction(s) being replaced.

* There are several conditions that must be met for an RBF replacement to occur, documented
  [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/policy/mempool-replacements.md),
  including a requirement that the replacement pay more fees than the original transaction(s).

* [PR 24007](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24007)
  implements something similar to RBF except the `txid` of the two transactions is the same
  (but the `wtxid`s are different). As it's not possible for a same-txid-different witness
  transaction to include a different absolute fee amount, the rules for witness replacement differ
  from that of regular RBF.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR?
   [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. A `wtxid` "commits to" an entire transaction, including its witness,
   while a `txid` does not. What does the phrase "commits to" mean in Bitcoin?

3. Is the mempool "indexed" by `txid` or `wtxid`? Equivalently, we can
   ask: Can the mempool contain multiple transactions with the same `txid`
   (but different `wtxid`s)? If not, would it make sense for it to do so?

4. Does this PR change a consensus rule? Why or why not? What happens
   if some nodes are running this PR and their peers are not?

5. Should Bitcoin Core policies be miner incentive-compatible?

6. When an RBF replacement occurs, why is it necessary to remove the
   descendant transactions?

7. When a witness replacement occurs, is it necessary to remove the
   descendant transactions? Why or why not?

8. This PR allows replacement even if the existing transaction hasn't
   signaled replaceability. Is this an oversight?

9. Why would a witness-replacement transaction be broadcast? Why not
   broadcast the replacement transaction initially? What is this PR's
   use case?

10. How can a transaction have multiple possible witness data that are
   different sizes? (Hint: see the
   [test!](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24007/commits/b15079ac7bc539df9854069b834f9ca437e79b8e#diff-bfc6ef96f9f5a9f10cabf5c2c18e832191e3f556f6fab0be240df109865216d8R51))

11. The PR
   [requires](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24007/files#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98R928)
   the replacement transaction's size to be 95% or less than the
   size of the replaced transaction. Why can't it just use the normal RBF rules?

12. Why is [this](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr24007/src/validation.cpp#L928)
    check written as (simplified) `new_size * 100 >= old_size * 95` rather than the more obvious
    `new_size >= old_size * 0.95 `?

13. (Extra credit) How does witness replacement interact with packages?
