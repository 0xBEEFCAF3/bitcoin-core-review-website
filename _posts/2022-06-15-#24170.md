## Notes

* Using Bitcoin Core on privacy networks such as Tor is good for enhancing the privacy of
own transactions and not revealing identity in general. However, Tor-only mode
is not without risks: Tor-only nodes may be susceptible to eclipse
attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and other types of attacks
(see e.g. [Biryukov, Pustogarov: Bitcoin over Tor isnâ€™t a good idea (2015)](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2015/papers-archived/6949a122.pdf)).

* To counter these downsides, some node operators might want to mainly be on a
privacy network, but still have a few manually picked clearnet peers that help
them stay on the best chain.
Currently, this would lead to transactions and addresses being relayed over
these connections and would also open up the
possibility of fingerprinting attacks, e.g. connecting a node's onion address
to its clearnet IP.

* Manual connections are additional outbound connections handpicked by the
node operator. They are regarded as trusted, so that a misbehaving manual
peer is not punished or disconnected in certain situations where an automatic
peer would be.

* After Issue [#23763](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23763) was
  opened requesting this, [PR
#24170](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24170) introduces the option of
specifying manual connections that are `block-relay-only`, i.e. don't
participate in transaction or address relay.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. Why could peers that are only active on privacy networks such as Tor be more
susceptible to eclipse attacks compared to clearnet-only peers?

1. What is the difference between the `onetry` and `add` modes in the `addnode` RPC?

1. What are the different options of adding a manual-block-relay peer that this PR
introduces? Did you try one out?

1. The PR introduces a new [connection
   type](https://github.com/mzumsande/bitcoin/blob/202112_manual_blocksonly/src/net.h#L123-L195)
`MANUAL_BLOCK_RELAY` that combines the
properties of `MANUAL` and `BLOCK_RELAY` peers. What are the advantages and
disadvantages of having an extra connection type, as opposed to combining the
logic of the existing ones?

1. [BIP324](https://bip324.com/), encrypted p2p traffic, is another privacy-enhancing
feature currently under development and review. What types of attacks that this PR
tries to mitigate are fixed by BIP324? Which ones aren't?
