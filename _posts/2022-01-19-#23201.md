## Notes

* Funding a transaction involves selecting inputs with a total amount that covers both the
  payment(s) and the fees for the transaction itself. The target feerate is calculated at the
  beginning, and the fees depend on the total size of the transaction.

* In some use cases, users may want to fund a transaction with *external inputs*, i.e., inputs that
  are not controlled by the user themselves, but some external wallet such as that of a LN
  channel counterparty. The challenge in this scenario is accounting for these inputs when funding
  the fees of the transaction - the wallet needs to know their size.

    - Given *solving data* such as public keys, scripts, or descriptors, the wallet can approximate
      the size of the input and corresponding witness data. For example,
      [this stackexchange post](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/48279/how-big-is-the-input-of-a-p2pkh-transaction)
      breaks down the possible sizes of a P2PKH input.

    - [PR #17211](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17211) added support for allowing
      users to provide solving data to help the wallet determine the size of external input(s).

    - Some sizes might differ depending on how the external wallet generates the signature. In these
      cases, the wallet uses the maximum possible size to avoid underestimating the fees needed to
      reach the target feerate.

    - Still, solving data might not be available and external inputs may be nonstandard.

* [PR #23201](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23201) adds support for specifying the weights
  of external inputs in the wallet RPCs `send`, `walletcreatefundedpsbt`, and `fundrawtransaction`.
  This allows the wallet to take these inputs into account when funding the transaction at a target
  feerate, even if it doesn't have the solving data for calculating the size itself.

    - This is achieved by adding a map from the input's outpoint to weight in `CCoinControl`.

    - If a user provides both solving data and input weights, the provided weight overrides the size
      calculated using solving data.

* Raw transactions are serialized in a specific
  [format](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/transactions.html#raw-transaction-format) which
  includes lengths and sizes (e.g. number of inputs in vin and number of bytes in the signature
  script) represented as [Compact Size Unsigned
  Integers](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/623745ca74cf3f54b474dac106f5802b7929503f/src/serialize.h#L240),
  which vary in length depending on the value.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What are some use cases of allowing external inputs to be used in `send`,
   `walletcreatefundedpsbt`, `fundrawtransaction`, and `bumpfee`?

3. Why might a user want to specify input weights instead of using the existing `solving_data` option?

4. Why does `FundTransaction()` need to know the external inputs ahead of time at all?

5. In the interface modified by this PR, how would a user call {`send`, `walletcreatefundedpsbt`,
   `fundrawtransaction`} to specify a maximum input weight?

6. The RPCs will throw a `JSONRPCError: RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER` if the specified weight is below 160.
   Why can't the weight of an input be less than 160?

7. Quiz: Given that an external input is a {P2PKH, P2WPKH, P2WSH, P2TR}, can you calculate the
   maximum weight you need to add to the transaction you're funding?

8. What is the purpose of `CCoinControl`? What are the different purposes of `CCoinControl` versus
   `CoinSelectionParams`?

9. What does the `FillInputToWeight()` function do?

10. Why does `FillInputToWeight` subtract the size of the Compact Size Uint from the `add_weight`?
