## Notes

- RPC methods can take parameters in three ways:
  - Using positional parameters, e.g. `bitcoin-cli getblock "00000000c937983704a73af28acdec37b049d214adbda81d7e2a3dd146f6ed09"`
  - Using named parameters, e.g. `bitcoin-cli named getblock blockhash="00000000c937983704a73af28acdec37b049d214adbda81d7e2a3dd146f6ed09"`
  - Using an `options` object, e.g. `bitcoin-cli -named bumpfee "66975ce3ea2b0815d677eaac1f1822276943cf7361d3eb920ad3cc278b473609" options='{"fee_rate": 10}'`

- For an end-user (especially through `bitcoin-cli`), the `options` notation can be quite verbose, especially when they just want to specify a single parameter.

- Some endpoints, such as `send`, allow passing parameters such as `conf_target` either as a `options` field or a named/positional parameter, but this comes with [code overhead](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6c7ebcc14b7908a67a8f8764b398e76c8fb4fe8b/src/wallet/rpc/spend.cpp#L57-L77) and needs to be implemented by every RPC method.

- To simplify the interface, [#26485](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26485) allows any `options` parameter to also be passed as a named parameter.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. Why do some RPCs use an `options` parameter? Do we still need it? If so, what for? If not, can we remove it?

1. Which function is responsible for checking if an `options` field is passed as a named parameter? What other approaches can you think of to achieve the same goal this PR is trying to achieve?

1. The [documentation for `send`](https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/24.0.0/rpc/wallet/send/) lists `conf_target` both as a named argument (#2) as well as a field in `options`. When looking at [the code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6c7ebcc14b7908a67a8f8764b398e76c8fb4fe8b/src/wallet/rpc/spend.cpp#L1180-L1233), however, it seems like `conf_target` is defined only [once](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6c7ebcc14b7908a67a8f8764b398e76c8fb4fe8b/src/wallet/rpc/spend.cpp#L1186). How is this possible?

1. Why does `RPCHelpMan::GetArgNames()` [now return](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/411485082c22b86e1224f60534fccf1e2bb8e8f3#diff-647c2f0c4261e4ba2bbfc487178f54f4702ad284b52c1ed2dbbd30a53a5ad487R609) a `std::vector<std::pair<std::string, bool>>` instead of a `std::vector<std::string>`? What does the `bool` represent?

1. In [`transformNamedArguments`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/411485082c22b86e1224f60534fccf1e2bb8e8f3#diff-019ee7d5e66b74eac42199f64e08cd0e90af4603bb3c105e294665ea4b411219R440), why do we use `__pushKV` instead of `pushKV`?

1. What is the `fr` input parameter? Why are [we handling this case separately](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/411485082c22b86e1224f60534fccf1e2bb8e8f3#diff-019ee7d5e66b74eac42199f64e08cd0e90af4603bb3c105e294665ea4b411219R460-R462)?
