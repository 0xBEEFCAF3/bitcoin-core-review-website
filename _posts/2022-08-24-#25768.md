## Notes

- The node has multiple local clocks, including the system clock and a mockable
  [`NodeClock`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d480586ecb1d4c265ffec278f10c46500d89382f/src/util/time.h#L18).

- The `setmocktime` regtest-only RPC sets the clock to a specific time in the past or future; the
  time does not continue to tick forward after that. This allows us to test node behaviors that
happen over a long period of time, such as peer disconnection after timeouts.

- The `CScheduler` maintains a map from time points to background tasks that should be called
periodically or sometime in the future. It runs in its own thread and is used for a variety of jobs
such as [periodically checking if we should find new
peers](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d480586ecb1d4c265ffec278f10c46500d89382f/src/net_processing.cpp#L1693)
or [rebroadcasting wallet
transactions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d480586ecb1d4c265ffec278f10c46500d89382f/src/wallet/load.cpp#L154).

- The `mockscheduler` regtest-only RPC "fast-forwards" scheduled jobs by making each time point
sooner. It does not modify the node's clock.

- The wallet periodically rebroadcasts its transactions that haven't been mined yet.
`ResendWalletTransactions()` is a task scheduled every 1000milliseconds. The task itself compares
the node's current (mockable) time and the wallet's randomly chosen `nNextResend` time to decide
whether or not it's time to call `SubmitTxMemoryPoolAndRelay()`. As such, to trigger a rebroadcast,
the clock must pass two time points: `CWallet::nNextResend` and the time at which the `scheduler`
has `MaybeResendWalletTxs()` task set for.

- [PR #25768](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25768) addresses an issue in which the wallet
  rebroadcasts multiple transactions with dependency relationships. It must submit a parent
transaction before its child, otherwise the mempool will reject it due to missing inputs.

- Prior to this PR, the transactions are rebroadcast in whichever order they appear in
  [`CWallet::mapWallet`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d480586ecb1d4c265ffec278f10c46500d89382f/src/wallet/wallet.h#L394-L396),
which is a `std::unordered_map`.

- This PR reuses the logic in `ReacceptWalletTransactions()` to sort `mapWallet` transactions by
  [`CWalletTx::nOrderPos`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d480586ecb1d4c265ffec278f10c46500d89382f/src/wallet/transaction.h#L185).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? What was your review approach?

1. Did you leave a [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review) on the PR?

### Concept

1. What incorrect behavior does this PR address?

1. Were you able to reproduce the issue? Does the test added in the PR adequately test this
   behavior, i.e., does it succeed with this fix but fail without it?

1. Why is it difficult to write a test that reliably demonstrates that transactions may be
   rebroadcast in the wrong order? How does `std::unordered_map` order its elements?

### Approach

1. Can you think of any other methods of getting the wallet transactions sorted in this order?

1. Would it make sense to *keep* the wallet transactions sorted in this order? Why is `mapWallet`
   implemented as a `std::unordered_map`; would another data structure make sense?

1. If you thought of an alternative approach, how does it compare? What is its runtime complexity?
   How much {more, less} memory is allocated? Does it require a lot of code to be
(re)written? Is its complexity appropriate for this purpose?

### Implementation

1. How is `GetSortedTxs()`, the function extracted from `ReacceptWalletTransactions()`, implemented?
   How much memory is needed, as a function of the transactions in `mapWallet`?

1. `GetSortedTxs()` is
   [declared](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/9a556564e9dc64ae0ad723c78da33d0c982f006f#diff-9ce137cd784ea308778842120aa2af6d2bb8369485b71f25e72b2a32cf0a5b21R536)
as requiring the wallet lock to already be held. Why or why not does this make sense?

1. A [structured binding declaration](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/structured_binding) is used in
   [two](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/9a556564e9dc64ae0ad723c78da33d0c982f006f#diff-1f2db0e4d5c12d109c7f0962333c245b49b696cb39ff432da048e9d6c08944d8R1826)
[places](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/9a556564e9dc64ae0ad723c78da33d0c982f006f#diff-1f2db0e4d5c12d109c7f0962333c245b49b696cb39ff432da048e9d6c08944d8R1831)
in `GetSortedTxs()`. What are the types of each variable (`wtxid`, `wtx`, `_`, and `wtx`) and what
do they represent? Why or why not is this better than declaring the types explicitly?

1. Can you find any behavior changes to `ReacceptWalletTransactions()`, or is it a move-only code
   change?

1. The test
   [calls](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/e40ddf36bed81bdf28d386eb961c9ed22b69e207#diff-2dd85d481900d4ad19d113d2114861b0134bcd283435e95b18d10adf5ad381a0R112-R113)
both `setmocktime` and `mockscheduler` to trigger a rebroadcast. What is the difference between
these two calls, and why or why not is it necessary to call both of them?

1. The test
   ["evicts"](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/e40ddf36bed81bdf28d386eb961c9ed22b69e207#diff-2dd85d481900d4ad19d113d2114861b0134bcd283435e95b18d10adf5ad381a0R101-R103)
the transactions from the mempool by calling `setmocktime`. Why is this necessary, and why does it
work?
