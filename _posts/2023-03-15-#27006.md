## Notes

- Once a block is fully validated, it is [saved to disk](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fc037c8c8395564133b066aeff04e8198708c82a/src/validation.cpp#L3931-L3936) in one of the `blk<nFile>.dat` files in your datadir.

- Blocks are received, validated and stored in an unpredictable order (and *not* sequentially based on block height), so we need to keep track of which file each block is stored in, in order to be able to access it quickly. This is tracked in [`CBlockIndex` by its members](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fc037c8c8395564133b066aeff04e8198708c82a/src/chain.h#L165-L172) `nFile` `nDataPos` and `nUndoPos`. In master, all of these members are guarded by the [`::cs_main`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/fc037c8c8395564133b066aeff04e8198708c82a/src/kernel/cs_main.h#L20) mutex. We have discussed how blocks are downloaded and stored in previous meetings [#24858](/24858) and [#25880](/25880).

- `::cs_main` [is a recursive mutex](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/106314/what-is-cs-main-why-is-it-called-cs-main) which is used to ensure that validation is carried out in an atomic way. Although in recent years a lot of effort has been made to reduce usage of `::cs_main`, it is still heavily used across the codebase.

- Having a single (global) mutex can allow for reduced code complexity and simplify reasoning about race conditions. However, it often also leads to (sometimes significant) performance issues when multiple threads are waiting for the same mutex even though they don't need synchronization and are not accessing any of the same variables.

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. `SharedLock` is [added](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/657e3086ad8171f799a7eb4226c6d1c2dd562a39#diff-b1924661640b70276005001174b3b3640f02be7232bb8d9a1b9518dde32f8055R253) as a new mutex type to complement the `UniqueLock` we already have. Why does a `UniqueLock` not suffice here? How are the implementations of `UniqueLock` and `SharedLock` different?

1. Do you expect this PR to have any visible impact on performance? If so, for which process(es) (in a very general sense) and by how much (order of magnitude)? Were you able to verify/benchmark this in practice?

1. This PR changes `CBlockIndex::nIndex` to default to `-1` instead of `0`. How can/did you verify that this change is safe?

1. `nFile`, `nDataPos` and `nUndoPos` [change](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/compare/657e3086ad8171f799a7eb4226c6d1c2dd562a39...acddd4204654812a0e741e04a758be0f362c5ccb#diff-05137bf4d07f31a6cc237b1dd772e0b38bc2a60610a7ca86827e98fc126e8407L166-R175) from being guarded by `::cs_main` to being guarded by `g_cs_blockindex_data`. Why is it that we lock exactly these 3 variables with `g_cs_blockindex_data`? What would be the concerns and benefits of using a different mutex for each of those 3 variables?

1. Are there any other ways to ensure the data integrity of `nFile`, `nDataPos` and `nUndoPos`?

1. With this PR, does the number of times that a mutex is acquired increase, stay constant, or decrease - or does it depend on the program flow?
