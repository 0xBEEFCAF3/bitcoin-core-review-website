## Notes

- [BIP 141
  (SegWit)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki)
  introduced a new structure called a `witness` to each transaction.
  Transactions' witnesses are commited to blocks separately from the
  transaction merkle tree. Witnesses contain data required to check transaction
  validity, but not required to determine transaction effects (output
  consumption/creation). In other words, witnesses are used to validate the
  blockchain state, not to determine what that state is.

  - Witnesses are commited to by placing the root of the *witness merkle tree* in
    the block's coinbase transaction. By doing so, the witnesses are also commited to
    in the transaction merkle tree through the coinbase transaction. Nesting the
    witness commitment in the coinbase transaction was done to make SegWit
    soft-fork compatible.

- `Assume-valid` is a node setting that makes the node skip some transaction
  validity checks (signature and script checks) prior to a pre-determined
  "known to be good" block (assume-valid point). The default assume-valid point
  is set by the developers and is updated every release, but users have the
  ability to set their own assume-valid point through the `-assumevalid`
  setting.

  - The assume-valid feature does not significantly change Bitcoin's security
    assumptions. If developers (and everyone reviewing the code changes) were
    to conspire with miners to build a more-work chain with invalid signatures
    (and go undetected for weeks), and then include it as the default
    assume-valid point, they could get the network to accept an invalid chain.
    However, those same people already have that power by just changing the
    code - which would be much less obvious.
    ([quoted](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/59940/what-are-the-trust-assumptions-in-assumed-valid-in-bitcoin-core-0-14))
    Additionally, as long as the full chain history remains available for
    auditing it would be hard for such an attack to go unnoticed.

  - It is also important to note that the configured assume-valid point does not
    dictate which chain a node follows. The node still does
    Proof of Work checks, meaning that a large reorg would be able
    to orphan (parts of) the assumed-valid chain.

- Nodes in prune mode (enabled by the `-prune` setting) fully download and
  validate the chain history to build a UTXO set enabling them to fully
  validate any new transaction, but only store a (configurable) portion of the
  recent history.

- [PR #27050](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050) proposes to skip
  downloading the witnesses for blocks prior to the configured assume-valid
  point, for nodes running in prune mode. The rationale for this change is that
  pruned nodes currently download witnesses but then (prior to the assume-valid
  point) don't validate them and delete them shortly after. So why not skip
  downloading those witnesses and save some bandwidth?

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   What was your review approach?

2. How much bandwidth is saved, i.e.,
   what is the cumulative size of all witness data up to block
   `0000000000000000000013a20dcc8577282e1eabd430592bb8afdd5fe544c05a`? (Hint:
   the `getblock` RPC returns the `size` and `strippedsize` (size excluding
   witnesses) for each block).

3. The end goal of the PR can be achieved with very few changes to the code
   (ignoring edge case scenarios). It essentially only requires two changes,
   one to the block request logic and one to block validation. Can you (in your
   own words) describe these two changes in more detail?

4. Without this PR, script validation is skipped under assume-valid, but other
   checks that involve witness data are not skipped. What other witness related
   checks exist as part of validation on master?

5. With this PR, all additional witness related checks (Q4) will be skipped for
   assumed-valid blocks. Is it ok to skip these additional checks? Why or why not?

6. The PR does not include an explicit code change for skipping all the extra
   checks from Q4. Why does that work out?

7. [Peter Todd left a
   comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#issuecomment-1423474935)
   concerning a reduction in security with the changes made in the PR. Can you
   in your own words summarize his concerns? Do you agree/disagree with them?
