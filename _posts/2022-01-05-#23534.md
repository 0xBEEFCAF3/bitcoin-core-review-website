## Notes

* The [`fundrawtransaction`
  RPC](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/fundrawtransaction.html) allows users to pass in
  a transaction with outputs filled in, and the wallet "funds" the payment and transaction fees by
  selecting UTXOs from the wallet's UTXO pool to spend in the transaction's inputs. The process of
  selecting which UTXOs to use is known as *Coin Selection*.

  - While transaction outputs have an amount,
    [`nValue`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d69af93223c4008c3255f7e4848ff05d78c514fa/src/primitives/transaction.h#L131),
    each added input increases the fee required to keep the transaction at a given feerate. As such, the
    *effective value* (`nValue` reduced by the UTXOâ€™s input size multiplied by the given feerate) is
    used during coin selection instead.

  - We have discussed Coin Selection and effective values in a [previous review club](/17331).

  - The `subtractFeeFromOutputs` argument in `fundrawtransaction` causes the payment amounts in
    the transaction to be reduced by the fee amount. We have discussed the behavior around subtracting
    fee from recipients in a [previous review club](/22155).

* [PR #23534](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23534) changes coin selection behavior to
  allow UTXOs with negative effective values to be selected when `subtractFeeFromOutputs` is on.

## Questions

### Conceptual Questions

1. Did you review the PR? What was your review approach?

2. What does the `subtractFeeFromOutputs` argument do in `fundrawtransaction`; how do you use it?
   Why might a user opt to subtract fees from outputs?

3. What does it mean for a coin to have *negative effective value*? Why does it usually *not* make
   sense to select negative effective value UTXOs?

4. What does this PR do? What are the advantages of disadvantages of its changes?

5. Since this is a wallet PR: could this change cause users to pay extreme fees, end up with dust
   outputs, or leak privacy? Would this be confusing to you as a user if you are using the default settings?

### Implementation Questions

6. What does the [first
   commit](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/227803cb95d3170613deddea67720879873f0754),
*set change fee only if not subtracting fee from outputs*, do? Does it change behavior?

7. How does `AttemptSelection()` know that the user wants to subtract fees from recipient outputs?
   (Trace the `fundrawtransaction` call; how does it eventually end up calling
   `AttemptSelection()`)?

8. What is the type of `bnb_result` declared
   [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/89d1d6ff4c79b31f4b6849c7ef906833cfd49d85#diff-6e06b309cd494ef5da4e78aa0929a980767edd12342137f268b9219167064d13R410)
   (and `srd_result` a few lines below)? How does it resolve as a boolean expression in the `if`
   statement?

      7a. (Bonus) Why might we use `auto` instead of declaring the type explicitly here?

      7b. (Bonus 2) Can you find other examples of this calling pattern in the codebase?

9. Why does the test need to call `generate`
   [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/a26a64c63dd8d55d0ac972f5420f5dd27e7f53d8#diff-729d780cd34193bdca2c44e9765fb47063bfbf88ba50e0864dad12d747033995R1170)?

10. Can you think of any logic that isn't tested by the functional test added in this PR? Do you
    have any suggestions to better test the changes added in this PR?
