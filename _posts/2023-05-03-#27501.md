## Notes

- Miners can call the `prioritisetransaction` RPC to modify the fees of mempool entries (e.g. to
  account for out-of-band fees or prioritise their own transactions). The difference "delta" is an
absolute fee amount which may be positive or negative. The miner can later "cancel" the
priority by calling the RPC again with the inverse value (e.g. 100sat and -100sat).

- In `CTxMemPool`, the delta is stored in 2 places.
	- Each [`CTxMemPoolEntry`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d89aca1bdbe52406f000e3fa8dda12c46dca9bdd/src/kernel/mempool_entry.h#L65) stores a "base" fee and a "modified" fee (base + delta).
	- [`CTxMemPool::mapDeltas`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/d89aca1bdbe52406f000e3fa8dda12c46dca9bdd/src/txmempool.h#L450)
	  is a map from txid to its delta.
- `mapDeltas` entries are never removed from mapDeltas except when the tx is mined in a block or conflicted (since [PR #6464](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6464)).
	- Mostly it is a feature to allow `prioritisetransaction` for a tx that isn't in the mempool
	  {yet, anymore}. A user can may resbumit a tx and it retains its priority, or mark a tx as
"definitely accept" before it is seen.
	- Since [PR #8448](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8448), `mapDeltas` is persisted to mempool.dat and loaded on restart. This is also
	  good, otherwise we lose prioritisation on restart.
	- Note the removal due to block/conflict is only done when `removeForBlock` is called, i.e.
	  when the block is received. If you load a mempool.dat containing `mapDeltas` with
transactions that were mined already (e.g. the file was saved prior to the last few blocks), you
don't delete them.
- There is no way to query the node for not-in-mempool `mapDeltas`. If you add a priority and forget
  what the value was, the only way to get that information is to inspect mempool.dat.
- Calling `prioritisetransaction` with an inverse value does not remove it from `mapDeltas`, it just
  sets the value to 0. It disappears on a restart (`LoadMempool` checks if delta is 0), but that
might not happen for a while.

- [PR #27501](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27501) adds an RPC to get prioritised
  transactions (also tells you whether the tx is in mempool or not), helping users clean up
`mapDeltas` manually. It also changes `CTxMemPool::PrioritiseTransaction` so that when a delta is
set to 0, it removes the entry from `mapDeltas` entirely.
