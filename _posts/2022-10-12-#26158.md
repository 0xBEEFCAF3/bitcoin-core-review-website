## Notes

- Benchmark tests help us monitor the performance of specific parts of the code by running it a large number of iterations and measuring how long it takes to run that piece of code, as well as how stable the results are.

- Benchmark tests are defined in `src/bench` and are based on the [`nanobench`](https://github.com/martinus/nanobench) framework. Instructions on how to compile and run the benchmarks can be found in [doc/benchmarking.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/benchmarking.md). It is highly recommended to do this prior to the review club.

- To ensure all benchmark tests work (i.e. can actually be ran without failing), `make check` [runs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2d8d9aecacfe5a5c3bce7807845456d82c674aa5/src/Makefile.test.include#L376-L378) the `bench_bitcoin` binary with option `-sanity-check` which sets the number of iterations for each test to just 1.

- During [an IRC meeting](https://bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch/ircmeetings/logs/bitcoin-core-dev/2022/bitcoin-core-dev.2022-09-22-19.00.moin.txt) _(#topic acceptable runtimes of new benchmarks (achow101))_, it was suggested that not all benchmarks need to be run or sanity checked all the time.

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. What is the initial motivation behind this proposed pchange? Does the approach in this PR sufficiently address that? Can you think of another, not necessarily (strictly) better, approach?

1. Are there any downsides to `make check` only running `-priority-level=high` benchmarks by default? Do you think the benefits outweigh the downsides?

1. Why do we need to `static_cast<PriorityLevel>` the return value when [`operator|(PriorityLevel a, PriorityLevel b)`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/cbc077e77a5d0ba8ae11b1f5d89480c997fdef55/src/bench/bench.h#L50)'s return type is `PriorityLevel` already?

1. In which sense is `PriorityLevel` an enum? In which sense is it a bit vector? What do you think about this approach?

1. Which levels can we pass to `-priority-level`? Are they all represented in [`map_priority_level`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/cbc077e77a5d0ba8ae11b1f5d89480c997fdef55/src/bench/bench.cpp#L47-L51)? How are the other one(s) resolved? Can you think of a different approach?

1. Were you able to compile and run the benchmarks? How did you test that the `-priority-level` argument works as expected?

1. Which benchmarks do you think should/could be labeled as `LOW` or `MEDIUM` priority? What did you base that decision on?

1. Quiz: Which of the following are valid `PriorityLevel`s:
   * a. PriorityLevel{0x00}
   * b. PriorityLevel{"low"}
   * c. PriorityLevel::DEFAULT_PRIORITY_LEVEL
   * d. PriorityLevel{3}
   * e. PriorityLevel{4}
   * f. PriorityLevel{0xff}
   * g. auto static_cast<PriorityLevel>(8)
