## Notes

- By default, a Bitcoin Core node allows up to 125 connections (8 of which are outbound) to other peers.

- There are different kinds of connections, such as block-relay-only, inbound, outbound-full-relay, manual, feeler, block-relay and addr-fetch.

- You can use the [`getpeerinfo`](https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/24.0.0/rpc/network/getpeerinfo/) RPC to get data about each connected network peer such as connection type, permissions and other information.

- `-whitelist` is a [startup option](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/dc905f6c2a60961aee73578fd3092bf90b28409f/src/init.cpp#L523-L525) that allows to add permission flags to the peers connecting from the given IP address or CIDR-notated network. It uses the same permissions as [`-whitebind`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/dc905f6c2a60961aee73578fd3092bf90b28409f/src/init.cpp#L519-L521): bloomfilter, noban, forcerelay, relay, mempool, download, addr).

- This PR builds on the work done in [#17167](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17167). #17167 proposed to change `-whitelist` to allow whitelisting outgoing connections, and this PR adds the `addpermissionflags` RPC to it.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. What does this PR do?

1. `-whitelist` only allows to add permission flags to inbound peers. Why only for inbound ones? Does it make sense to extend the permissions to outbound peers? Why?

1. Considering we already have the `-whitelist` startup option, why would an RPC be useful? What do we want to avoid?

1. This PR [adds](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/7dc3ac9cd5fcbb1da42f57fd02aa2f3dff325dd3#diff-bcb9f9354b59da783335c9a2b9d706fd5679e94bf63d67a17959544ef7255343R23-R24) a `ConnectionDirection` parameter in `TryParsePermissionFlags` to control whether it will apply the permissions to inbound or outbound connections. In [netbase.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/dc905f6c2a60961aee73578fd3092bf90b28409f/src/netbase.h#L38),`ConnectionDirection` has 2 operators overloading. Could you explain how Operator Overloading in C++ works and how it has been used in `ConnectionDirection`?

1. `ConnectionDirection` can be `Both`, `In`, `Out` or `None`. What happens in `TryParsePermissionFlags` if it is `None`? In which scenarios can this happen?

1. In the `addpermissionflags` RPC we receive an array of permission flags and the IP (or network). However, we convert it to a string of the following format: "<[permissions@]IP address or network>". Why?

1. (Bonus) How could this PR avoid the "problem" presented in [#26970](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26970)?
