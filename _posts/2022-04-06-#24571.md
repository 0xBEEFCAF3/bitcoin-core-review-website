## Notes

* Attackers may use
  [fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint) techniques
  to recognize the same node across different connections. This makes it
  possible to test if two addresses belong to the same node, which we generally
  try to avoid especially for addresses belonging to privacy-centric networks
  such as Tor. Some fingerprinting attacks work across restarts of the victim's
  node, making it possible to detect if a node changes addresses.

* A variety of fingerprinting techniques have been patched or mitigated.
  For example, attackers could have used requests for old non-main-chain
  headers/blocks ([#5820](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5820),
  [#8408](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8408),
  [#11113](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11113)), [`addr` message
  timestamps](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5860) and [prune
  depth](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11740) to fingerprint nodes.

* The fingerprintable behaviour that [PR
  #24571](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24571) addresses occurs when
  a node receives headers from a peer (handled in
  [`PeerManagerImpl::ProcessHeadersMessage`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1021e4cc6877f66729e01a6662d5877e718ed276/src/net_processing.cpp#L2148)).
  If the received headers don't connect to any header in the node's block
  index, then it will request additional headers via a `getheaders` message in
  an attempt to connect the chain.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What is the block index and what is it used for? (Hint: look at the usage of
[`m_block_index`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1a54c060b3b30220ec40a4b3cc4a0eb43586e982/src/node/blockstorage.h#L124))

3. Why and how can the block index be used for fingerprinting? (Hint: it has to
do with stale blocks/headers)

4. Why do we keep stale blocks in the block index?

5. In your own words, how does the fingerprinting technique outlined in the PR
work?

6. Does the fingerprinting technique outlined in the PR work across restarts of
the target node?

7. [This
commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24571/commits/18fa51e06a37270341e1d5a7ab3b3cb14d7fa3fd)
introduces a new parameter to `PeerManagerImpl::BlockRequestAllowed`. Why is
that necessary?
