## Notes

- This PR is a re-attempt of [PR 15845](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15845)
from 2019, which was closed without being merged. PR 15845 was the
subject of an earlier [review club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15845).
Its notes apply here as well.

- This PR is a performance improvement (no functional difference).

- [BIP 157](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0157.mediawiki)
(see also [review club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/18960))
adds the P2P support (light client protocol) for block filters, while
[BIP 158](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki)
specifies the filters themselves. This PR takes advantage of BIP 158.

- One difference between this PR and 15845 is that this PR works only with
descriptor wallets, which is a more recent type of wallet added in v0.17 (2019).

- To review this PR, you will need to create a descriptor wallet. This requires
building your node with `sqlite`; see the
[build instructions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc)
for your environment (search for "sqlite").

- `bitcoind` does not automatically create a descriptor wallet
(or any wallet). To create a wallet, run the
[`createwallet` RPC](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/createwallet.html).
You don't need to specify any arguments except wallet name, such as `my_wallet`
(the default is to create a descriptor wallet).

- Descriptor wallets are described in
[doc/descriptors.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md).

- It's probably best to also use `-signet=1`, since you can run a non-pruned node.
You can get some coins to play with at the [Signet Faucet](https://signet.bc-2.jp/).

- When your done is finished syncing, you can run and time the `rescanblockchain`
RPC.

- You can restart with block filters enabled using `-blockfilterindex=1`, and
run `-rescanblockchain` again to use the optimization.

- The `getindexinfo` RPC will show you if block filter index is enabled.

- The `listreceivedbyaddress` RPC will show you received transactions; this
list should be the same with and without `-blockfilterindex=1` (and with and
without running this PR's branch).

- The [PR description](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25957#issue-1354921936)
links to a
[benchark script](https://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/blob/fast_rescan_functional_test_benchmark/test/functional/pr25957_benchmark.py).

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR?
[Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. Why would a node operator enable BIP 158 filters (`-blockfilterindex=1`)? Does this PR affect the motivation?

1. What downsides, if any, are there to enabling BIP 158 filters?

1. Were you able to set up and run the PR on `signet` as described in the Notes?
Did you see a difference in performance with and without `-blockfilterindex`?

1. Were you able to run the 
[benchark script](https://github.com/theStack/bitcoin/blob/fast_rescan_functional_test_benchmark/test/functional/pr25957_benchmark.py)?

1. What is the advantage of descriptor wallets compared to legacy wallets,
especially in the creation of the filter set?
(Hint: what exact type of data do we need to put into the filter set?)

1. On a new descriptor wallet with default settings (i.e. 'keypoolsize=1000'), how many elements would we need to put the filter set?
(Hint: the
[`listdescriptors` RPC](https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/22.0.0/rpc/wallet/listdescriptors/)
can be used to count the number of descriptors created)

1. What is the difference between active and non-active descriptors,
and why does this distinction matter for this PR?
(Hint: see
[`GetActiveScriptPubKeyMans()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5291933fedceb9df16eb9e4627b1d7386b53ba07/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L3293) and
[`GetAllScriptPubKeyMans()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5291933fedceb9df16eb9e4627b1d7386b53ba07/src/wallet/wallet.cpp#L3307)
respectively.)

1. What problem did the earlier version of this PR
([15845](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15845) not address?
([Hint](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15845#issuecomment-625768563))
How this PR solve this problem?

1. Why can't we directly request the block filter index in the rescanning period and have to use the chain interface instead?
