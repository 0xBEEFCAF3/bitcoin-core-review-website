## Notes

* [PR #17261](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17261) introduced the `ScriptPubKeyMan`
  interface for classes for managing keys and scripts. All of the key and script management
  code for the Legacy wallet was moved into a `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan`.

* [PR #16528](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16528) introduced Descriptor wallets, an
  entirely new type of wallet which uses [output script descriptors](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md)
  to manage keys and scripts in a wallet. This was implemented by introducing a
  `DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan`.

* The old type of wallets are referred to as Legacy wallets and they are slowly being deprecated
  and removed. However there needs to be a way to turn a Legacy wallet into a Descriptor wallet
  so that users do not find themselves unable to use their wallet.

* In addition to changing how keys and scripts are tracked, Descriptor wallets also redefine the
  concept (and implementation) of `IsMine`. Instead of allowing both private keys and watch-only addresses in a single
  wallet, Descriptor wallets can either always have private keys, or never have private keys.

* [PR #19602](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/19602) implements an RPC which migrates a Legacy wallet into a descriptor wallet by computing
  descriptors for everything the legacy wallet would have considered to belong to it. These
  descriptors are subsequently added to a newly created descriptor wallet with the same name as
  the original Legacy wallet.

* Legacy wallets determine whether a script belongs to it by checking to see if it would be able
  to sign for the script, or the script is explicitly being watched. Descriptor wallets determine
  this by comparing the script to the set of scripts computed from the stored descriptors.

* This PR is a step in the [roadmap](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/20160) for the
  eventual removal of the Legacy wallet and the Berkeley DB dependency.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. Try creating a Legacy wallet and then migrating it using `migratewallet`. How can you tell if the migration was successful?

   * A Legacy wallet can be created with `bitcoin-cli -named createwallet wallet_name=<name> descriptors=false`

3. In your own words, briefly describe the migration process.

4. What kind of scripts will a Legacy wallet consider to belong to it for a single key
   (Hint: Look at [`LegacyScriptPubKeyMan::IsMine`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/267917f5632a99bb51fc3fe516d8308e79d31ed1/src/wallet/scriptpubkeyman.cpp#L215))?

5. Under what circumstances will a Legacy wallet watch for a multisig?

6. Why is `LegacyScriptPubKeyMan::GetAllScriptPubKeys()` needed
   (Hint: Consider how [`DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan::IsMine`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/267917f5632a99bb51fc3fe516d8308e79d31ed1/src/wallet/scriptpubkeyman.cpp#L1705) works))?

7. Why isn't the HD seed ignored when looking at all of the keys in a Legacy wallet?

8. What happens to watch-only addrsses, scripts, and pubkeys that were in the Legacy wallet?

9. What happens if the migration fails for some reason? How does the user recover their wallet?
