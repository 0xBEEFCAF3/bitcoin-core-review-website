## Notes

* On block-relay-only connections (introduced in [PR #15759](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15759)),
transaction and address relay are disabled. Currently, Bitcoin Core nodes
per default make two outbound block-relay-only connections in addition to 8 regular
outbound connections.\
Block-relay-only connections have been subject of multiple review club sessions,
among them [#15759](/15759) on the PR introducing them.

* Currently, block-relay-only connections are established
indirectly:
    - When making an outbound block-relay-only
    connection, a node sets the boolean flag `fRelay` in the version message to `false`.

    - `fRelay` (introduced in the context of [BIP37](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki))
    does not imply that transactions cannot be sent for the entire duration of the
    connection - in its original use case with BIP37, relay of transactions can
    be activated later on.

    - `fRelay=false` is also used in *-blocksonly* mode, a low-bandwidth
    option in which a node does not want to receive transactions from *any peer*,
    but does participate in address relay.

    - Therefore, nodes currently don't have a notion which of their incoming peers
    see the connection as block-relay-only and don't have any logic attached to it.

* [PR #20726](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20726),
accompanied by the new BIP proposal [BIP338](https://github.com/sdaftuar/bips/blob/2021-02-bip338-fixups/bip-0338.mediawiki),
introduces the new p2p message `disabletx` for block-relay-only connections, which
makes it explicit that no messages related to transaction relay should ever be
exchanged over the duration of the connection.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What are the benefits of introducing the `disabletx` message? What are the downsides, if any?

3. When a node makes an outgoing block-relay-only connection, it will send a
`disabletx` message after this PR. Will there be other changes in behavior for the
sender beyond this (if yes, which ones)?

4. When a node receives both `fRelay=false` and a `disabletx` message from an incoming peer, will it behave
differently after this PR? If yes, how?

5. Earlier discussions in the PR revolved around the interaction of `disabletx` and address
relay. Why is it, after [PR #21528](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21528),
no longer necessary to change any address-relay related code in this PR?

6. The new `m_disable_tx` field of the `Peer` struct is of type `std::atomic<bool>`.
Why is an [`std::atomic`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic) used
here instead of a simple bool, or a bool guarded by a lock?

7. There have also been suggestions to achieve some of the goals of this PR without
introducing a new message, as in [PR #22778](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22778).
Do you prefer an indirect approach to the explicit approach of this PR?
