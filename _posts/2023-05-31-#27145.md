## Notes

- A transaction is considered *conflicted* when one or more of its inputs has been spent by another
confirmed transaction. A conflicted transaction is marked with negative depth equal to the number of
confirmations on the conflicting transaction.

- It's possible for a transaction to have previously been in a block that used to be part of the
most-work chain but has since been reorged out.

- The wallet keeps track of relevant transactions and their confirmation status. This information is
  used to calculate the wallet's balance(s). For example:

    - If a transaction that is 100 blocks deep in the most-work chain, the wallet can
      reasonably include its UTXOs in the balance displayed to the user.

    - If a transaction conflicts with another transaction 100 blocks deep in the most-work chain,
      the wallet can be equally sure that, even though the transaction may have a valid signature,
      its UTXOs do not count towards the user's balance.

    - If a transaction is unconfirmed and in the node's mempool, the wallet should account for its
      UTXOs, but not consider them as safe as confirmed ones.

- The author has provided more notes on transaction states and their effects on balance calculation [here](https://gist.github.com/ishaanam/846adf3b453c3a85fe6e15c882c57ae0#locations-where-tx-states-are-updated).

- [Wallet Transaction Conflict
  Tracking](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Wallet-Transaction-Conflict-Tracking)
across chainstate and mempool events is tricky. As described in [Issue #7315](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7315),
when a block is disconnected, the wallet should be marking conflicted transactions as inactive, but
isn't currently doing so. [PR #27145](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27145) updates the behavior to mark
transactions that are no longer conflicting after a reorg as inactive.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. What is the issue this PR addresses? Can you reproduce the problem described? (Hint: try running
   wallet\_conflicts.py on master. What error do you get?)

1. What are the different
   [states](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/25202cace9140870c75cb3a811e10045df88c226/src/wallet/transaction.h#L243)
a `CWalletTx` can be in?

1. Which, if any, of the `TxState`s are "final," i.e. once a transaction reaches this
state, it will never change again?

1. Where in net\_processing.cpp is `CWallet::blockDisconnected()` triggered to be executed (Hint: it is
   not directly called. See
[`CValidationInterface`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/66b08e78226059e2d31450aadc2423d77003eaf1/src/validationinterface.h#L61-L76))?
Which thread executes this wallet function?

1. What does the wallet do with
   [`TxUpdate::NOTIFY_CHANGED`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/096487c4dcfadebe5ca959927f5426cae1c304d5#diff-9ce137cd784ea308778842120aa2af6d2bb8369485b71f25e72b2a32cf0a5b21R328)? (Who is notifying whom, of what?)

1. What does `RecursiveUpdateTxState()` do and why is it "recursive"? What are its callsites?
   (Before you grep, where do you think this function should be called?)

1. What is tested in wallet\_conflicts.py? Can you think of any other cases that should be tested?
