## Notes

- Package transactions submitted to the [`submitpackage`](https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/26.0.0/rpc/rawtransactions/submitpackage/) RPC successfully are accepted to the node's mempool, but broadcasted to peers individually because [package relay](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/package-relay/) is currently a work in progress. Successful submission does not mean the transactions will propagate.

- `maxburnamount` is an optional parameter for the `sendrawtransaction` RPC that helps prevent users from accidentally burning funds. Transactions with a data carrier `OP_RETURN` output amount that exceeds `maxburnamount` (default value: 0) are not submitted or broadcasted.

  - Upon decoding a transaction in `sendrawtransaction` and `testmempoolaccept` RPCs, `maxburnamount` is checked immediately.

- `maxfeerate` is an optional parameter for the [`sendrawtransaction`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L35) and [`testmempoolaccept`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L104) RPCs. Transactions exceeding this feerate won't be added to mempool and broadcasted to peers, helping prevent unintentional overpayment.

  - `testmempoolaccept` performs `maxfeerate` check after package processing. For each successful transaction, it uses the base fee and transaction virtual size in the validation result to check that the feerate [does not exceed](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L218) `maxfeerate`.

  - In the `sendrawtransaction` RPC, `maxfeerate` check is performed by calculating the transaction size fee at `maxfeerate` fee rate (as [`max_raw_tx_fee`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L89)) and passing it to [`BroadcastTransaction`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/node/transaction.cpp#L33). `BroadcastTransaction` first does a test accept in order to get the fee and virtual size of the transaction. Transactions whose feerate does not exceed the `max_raw_tx_fee` are then submitted to the mempool and broadcasted if successful.

- This PR adds optional parameters `maxfeerate` and `maxburnamount` to the [`submitpackage`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L816) RPC, enabling similar checks on package transactions.

  - After [decoding each package transaction in `submitpackage`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e69796c79c0aa202087a13ba62d9fbcc1c8754d4/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L814), it checks `maxburnamount` for each output.

  - It introduces the `max_sane_feerate` parameter to the [`ProcessNewPackage`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/validation.h#L282) function. `submitpackage` passes `maxfeerate` as `max_sane_feerate`.

  - `ProcessNewPackage` forwards `max_sane_feerate` to [`AcceptPackage`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/validation.cpp#L1450).

  - Transactions with individual modified feerates exceeding `max_sane_feerate` are not accepted into the mempool.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

2. Why is it important to perform these checks on submitted packages?

3. Are there other important checks apart from `maxburnamount` and `maxfeerate` that should be performed on packages before they are accepted to the mempool?

4. The options `maxburnamount` and `maxfeerate` can prevent a transaction from entering the mempool and being relayed. Can we consider these options as policy rules? Why or why not?

5. The commit message states: "This allows subpackage processing and is compatible with future package RBF work." What makes this compatible with future RBF work?

6. Why do we validate `maxfeerate` against the modified feerate instead of the base fee rate? 

7. We validate `maxfeerate` against the modified feerate of individual package transactions, not package feerate.
    - When can this be inaccurate?
    - Why not use package feerate instead?
    - Under what conditions might it become problematic?

8. Why can't `maxfeerate` be checked immediately after decoding like `maxburnamount` is?

9. How does the `maxfeerate` check in [`testmempoolaccept` RPC](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e69796c79c0aa202087a13ba62d9fbcc1c8754d4/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L104) differ from `submitpackage` RPC? Why can't they be the same?

10. Can you think of a different approach from the one taken by this PR? What are the tradeoffs?

17:01 <abubakarsadiq> Hello everyone today we are looking at PR #28950 authored by instagibbs, notes and question are available here https://bitcoincore.reviews/28950
17:01 <Ayelen> hi
17:01 <instagibbs> hi
17:01 <vmammal> hey cguida!
17:01 <cguida> sup vmammal!
17:01 <abubakarsadiq> Anyone joining us for the first time today? even if you're just lurking, feel free to say hi! thanks for joining @instagibbs
17:01 <henmeh> hi
17:02 <effexzi> Hi every1 
17:02 <abubakarsadiq> Have you read the notes, review or tested the PR   (y/n)? 
17:02 <abubakarsadiq> If you reviewed it  Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK? 
17:02 <monlovesmango> hey
17:03 <vmammal> ACK
17:03 <monlovesmango> y, no opinion on ACK/NACK
17:03 <larryruane_> hi
17:03 <hernanmarino> not me , just lurking today 
17:04 <abubakarsadiq> Okay lets jump right in
17:04 <abubakarsadiq> 1. Why is it important to perform these checks on submitted packages?
17:04 <monlovesmango> to prevent users from unintentionally losing funds?
17:04 <larryruane_> is it just that if there's a reason to have a check on a single tx submission, then that check would also make sense for the txes within a package?
17:05 <larryruane_> (i know that's kind of obvious, i may be missing something!)
17:05 <abubakarsadiq> yes @monlovesmango @larryruane it will be helpful to users in ensuring the transactions in packages they are adding to their mempool and broadcasting to peers does not pay unreasonable fee rate
17:06 <abubakarsadiq> Also ensuring they dont burn money above some threshold.
17:06 <abubakarsadiq> 2.Are there other important checks apart from maxburnamount and maxfeerate that should be performed on packages before they are accepted to the mempool?
17:07 <larryruane_> you mean checks that already exist?
17:08 <vmammal> 2. yes, various policy rules, descendant limits, etc
17:08 <monlovesmango> can only really think of consensus and policy rules
17:08 <abubakarsadiq> yes like base fee check can also be helpful I think
17:08 <cguida> rbf rules
17:09 <abubakarsadiq> rbf rules, policy and consensus check are done during package processing
17:10 <monlovesmango> is package processing done prior to acceptance into mempool then?
17:10 <abubakarsadiq> maybe we can also  can also check package transactions does not exceed the maximum standard transaction size and fail early. However I don't think users should configure this?
17:10 <larryruane_> validation.cpp: PreChecks() has a bunch of checks
17:11 <abubakarsadiq> Yes @larryruane
17:12 <larryruane_> you mean users should not configure the max standard transaction size?
17:13 <GregTonoski> Do I understand correctly that the RPC sendrawtransaction will not be unsuccessful ("rejected") by default if there is OP_RETURN?
17:13 <abubakarsadiq> No we could just check max standard transaction size early and avoid the work
17:14 <abubakarsadiq> 3. The options `maxburnamount` and `maxfeerate` can prevent a transaction from entering the mempool and being relayed. Can we consider these options as policy rules? Why or why not?
17:15 <cguida> GregTonoski: just submitpackage, not submitrawtransaction i think
17:15 <abubakarsadiq> @GregTonoski if the value in the `OP_RETURN` exceeds `maxburnamount` set by user, if not set default value of 0.
17:16 <larryruane_> I guess they are policy, but only local for this node. Definitely not consensus!
17:16 <monlovesmango> I think no, bc this only affects the tx that you are broadcasting and not transactions you are relaying..?
17:16 <larryruane_> monlovesmango: that's a good point!
17:16 <monlovesmango> but do agree that these are personal policy rules
17:16 <abubakarsadiq> @cguida do we have `submitrawtransaction` I think he is right it's `sendrawtransaction`
17:17 <abubakarsadiq> Thats what I think also, its policy 
17:17 <cguida> oh snap, you are correct GregTonoski, my bad
17:18 <monlovesmango> but just to confirm, this doesn't change the policy for relaying tx right?
17:19 <abubakarsadiq> No it does not, it only affect broadcasted transactions from the RPC's.
17:19 <monlovesmango> cool thank you!
17:19 <abubakarsadiq> 4. The commit message states: “This allows subpackage processing and is compatible with future package RBF work.” What makes this compatible with future RBF work?
17:21 <monlovesmango> it enables checks on package transactions? (just guessing heeh)
17:21 <abubakarsadiq> My guess is its compatible with package RBF, maybe @instagibbs can chip in here :)
17:22 <instagibbs> right, basically moving forward we'll probably process packages in "chunks", but maybe post cluster mempool we cna abort even earlier?
17:23 <instagibbs> I dont remember the exactm eaning behind the commit message, I should probably update it :) 
17:23 <abubakarsadiq> Is it because subpackage processing is where package RBF rules will be checked, and we check the individual modified fee rate against `maxfeerate` during subpackage evaluation/
17:24 <glozow> instagibbs: maybe you were distinguishing between sub(ancestor)packages and chunks
17:25 <monlovesmango> so is "This allows subpackage processing WHICH is compatible with future package RBF work." more apt for the description of the commit?
17:26 <abubakarsadiq> We can continue discussing on that.
17:26 <abubakarsadiq> 5. Why do we validate maxfeerate against the modified feerate instead of the base fee rate?
17:27 <vmammal> if present, modified feerate will always override the base feerate ?
17:27 <monlovesmango> bc modified feerate is higher than base feerate:
17:27 <monlovesmango> ?
17:27 <glozow> I don't see a good reason why tbh
17:27 <glozow> modified isn't necessarily higher than base, no. you can prioritise with a negative value
17:27 <abubakarsadiq> I not sure why also It's a bit unclear to me that `sendrawtransaction` and `testmempoolaccept` `maxfeerate` checks are validated against base fee while `submitpackage` is using a modified fee rate.
17:28 <abubakarsadiq> I mean base fee rate
17:28 <vmammal> glozow ah, true
17:29 <monlovesmango> where can I read about the difference between base fee rate and modified fee rate?
17:29 <larryruane_> glozow: I think I see what you mean; the maxfeerate is a local parameter so the user can adjust that param directly (user would know the modified feerate)
17:29 <glozow> presumably we want to check that the actual, real fees paid by the user are not too high
17:30 <instagibbs> I don't know, with non-trivial structures I think that will be difficult. modified feerate is what drives subpackage eval, and would drive linearization post-cluster mempool?
17:31 <glozow> yeah, but this is only checking individual right now anyway
17:32 <abubakarsadiq> Talking about individual 
17:32 <abubakarsadiq> We validate maxfeerate against the modified feerate of individual package transactions, not package feerate.
17:32 <abubakarsadiq> When can this be inaccurate?
17:32 <glozow> I guess you're worried about a prioritisation that would change the linearization/chunking?
17:33 <vmammal> monlovesmango I think `getrawmempool` and `prioritisetransaction` rpcs have some info on base vs modified
17:33 <instagibbs> glozow it definitely will change it, but if you think modified is the wrong thing, then maybe the future approach would ahve been wrong too
17:34 <glozow> maybe we should omit the check if there’s prioritisation 🤷🏻‍♀️
17:34 <monlovesmango> thank you vmammal!
17:34 <instagibbs> messing with priority is kind of asking for pain if you aren't careful
17:35 <monlovesmango> abubakarsadiq: would it be inaccurate if we bump the fee to be higher than 'maxfeerate' and then subsequently bump the package fee to be lower than 'maxfeerate'?
17:35 <glozow> instagibbs: yeah. maybe add a bool arg to the RPC for checking even if prioritised?
17:35 <abubakarsadiq> even if prioritization affect linearization, I think the aim is to check the actual fee rate, should do just because thats what other nodes will see when its broadcasted?
17:36 <glozow> Yeah. But I don't think we'll have logic to have an alternate linearization for non-modified, which is why I'm suggesting to just skip it
17:36 <instagibbs> abubakarsadiq I don't know if that's practical. The mempool will be totally ordered via modified fee(like today)
17:37 <instagibbs> well, it's not totally ordered now
17:37 <abubakarsadiq> In advance :P
17:37 <glozow> could have a RPC param to "force check chunk feerate even though it's based on modified fees"
17:39 <abubakarsadiq> @monlovesmango: I think its when the package child transaction is rejected because its modified fee rate exceeds `maxfeerate` individually, but does not if it's checked as a package.
17:39 <glozow> monlovesmango: we've discussed modified fees in https://bitcoincore.reviews/24152, https://bitcoincore.reviews/24538, and https://bitcoincore.reviews/27501
17:40 <monlovesmango> thanks abubakarsadiq and glozow!
17:41 <glozow> basically imagine CPFPing something very large with a small transaction. child might be super high feerate, but the package feerate is not.
17:42 <abubakarsadiq> exactly @glozow we might accept the child ancestors at a lower mining score.
17:42 <monlovesmango> interesting
17:42 <instagibbs> hmm, when the parent is in the mempool, this check will likely trip as it doesnt take the low fee parent into account
17:42 <instagibbs> (with a high fee child)
17:43 <abubakarsadiq> A follow-up question is why check `maxfeerate` against package feerate instead then?
17:44 <abubakarsadiq> why not*
17:47 <vmammal> i feel like maxfeerate check should occur on a package, if possible. it seems the answer given on the PR is that this check occurs "prior to any relay"
17:47 <glozow> vmammal: is it possible?
17:47 <vmammal> oh wait
17:48 <vmammal> scoring a package relies on chainstate context ?
17:48 <glozow> well, all of this needs chainstate
17:48 <abubakarsadiq> I dont think it would be possible with the current approach  because the transaction fee and size are determined during subpackage processing, we have to just check at that time, the subpackage will be added to the mempool (if it passed the check) before the next subpackage is going to be evaluated.
17:50 <abubakarsadiq> By the time we know the modified fee and size of all the package transactions some might have been added to the mempool already
17:51 <glozow> no, it's because subpackages aren't chunks, they aren't necessarily grouped as CPFPs
17:52 <glozow> we know the aggregate package feerate, but it's not an accurate assessment. Let's say you have parents A and B, and child C. parent B spends parent A.
17:52 <glozow> Let's say A pays 0 fees
17:52 <glozow> and B bumps it
17:53 <glozow> A+B is a CPFP, and C can be on its own
17:54 <glozow> Ah, is this still a concern if it's a tree?
17:55 <monlovesmango> would C still be considered part of the aggregate package in this scenario?
17:55 <abubakarsadiq> A+B+C will be evaluated as a subpackage, because A will fail individually, B and C due to missing inputs
17:56 <glozow> abubakarsadiq: correct
17:56 <abubakarsadiq> So if we evaluate the `maxfeerate` against  A+B+C package its incorrect, ah I see
17:56 <glozow> However it just occurred to me that this topology isn't allowed through the RPC
17:57 <monlovesmango> abubakarsadiq: can you expand on why it would be incorrect?
17:58 <abubakarsadiq> because we dont accept 0 fee txs yet?
18:00 <glozow> No - so imagine that A+B are large and together not above the maxfeerate, but C is. C should fail the maxfeerate check, but wouldn't because its fees are absorbed by A+B in the aggregation
19:00 <abubakarsadiq> @monlovesmango because B CPFP A,  and C is an individual txs. so should instead check against (A,B) and then check against (C) seperately.
