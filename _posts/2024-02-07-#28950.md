## Notes

- Package transactions submitted to the [`submitpackage`](https://bitcoincore.org/en/doc/26.0.0/rpc/rawtransactions/submitpackage/) RPC successfully are accepted to the node's mempool, but broadcasted to peers individually because [package relay](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/package-relay/) is currently a work in progress. Successful submission does not mean the transactions will propagate.

- `maxburnamount` is an optional parameter for the `sendrawtransaction` RPC that helps prevent users from accidentally burning funds. Transactions with a data carrier `OP_RETURN` output amount that exceeds `maxburnamount` (default value: 0) are not submitted or broadcasted.

  - Upon decoding a transaction in `sendrawtransaction` and `testmempoolaccept` RPCs, `maxburnamount` is checked immediately.

- `maxfeerate` is an optional parameter for the [`sendrawtransaction`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L35) and [`testmempoolaccept`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L104) RPCs. Transactions exceeding this feerate won't be added to mempool and broadcasted to peers, helping prevent unintentional overpayment.

  - `testmempoolaccept` performs `maxfeerate` check after package processing. For each successful transaction, it uses the base fee and transaction virtual size in the validation result to check that the feerate [does not exceed](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L218) `maxfeerate`.

  - In the `sendrawtransaction` RPC, `maxfeerate` check is performed by calculating the transaction size fee at `maxfeerate` fee rate (as [`max_raw_tx_fee`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L89)) and passing it to [`BroadcastTransaction`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/node/transaction.cpp#L33). `BroadcastTransaction` first does a test accept in order to get the fee and virtual size of the transaction. Transactions whose feerate does not exceed the `max_raw_tx_fee` are then submitted to the mempool and broadcasted if successful.

- This PR adds optional parameters `maxfeerate` and `maxburnamount` to the [`submitpackage`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L816) RPC, enabling similar checks on package transactions.

  - After [decoding each package transaction in `submitpackage`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e69796c79c0aa202087a13ba62d9fbcc1c8754d4/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L814), it checks `maxburnamount` for each output.

  - It introduces the `max_sane_feerate` parameter to the [`ProcessNewPackage`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/validation.h#L282) function. `submitpackage` passes `maxfeerate` as `max_sane_feerate`.

  - `ProcessNewPackage` forwards `max_sane_feerate` to [`AcceptPackage`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/bf6fbea9794db5e8d0adce8ff6182574808cea54/src/validation.cpp#L1450).

  - Transactions with individual modified feerates exceeding `max_sane_feerate` are not accepted into the mempool.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

2. Why is it important to perform these checks on submitted packages?

3. Are there other important checks apart from `maxburnamount` and `maxfeerate` that should be performed on packages before they are accepted to the mempool?

4. The options `maxburnamount` and `maxfeerate` can prevent a transaction from entering the mempool and being relayed. Can we consider these options as policy rules? Why or why not?

5. The commit message states: "This allows subpackage processing and is compatible with future package RBF work." What makes this compatible with future RBF work?

6. Why do we validate `maxfeerate` against the modified feerate instead of the base fee rate? 

7. We validate `maxfeerate` against the modified feerate of individual package transactions, not package feerate.
    - When can this be inaccurate?
    - Why not use package feerate instead?
    - Under what conditions might it become problematic?

8. Why can't `maxfeerate` be checked immediately after decoding like `maxburnamount` is?

9. How does the `maxfeerate` check in [`testmempoolaccept` RPC](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e69796c79c0aa202087a13ba62d9fbcc1c8754d4/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L104) differ from `submitpackage` RPC? Why can't they be the same?

10. Can you think of a different approach from the one taken by this PR? What are the tradeoffs?
