## Notes

- The [`getblockheader` RPC](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/getblockheader.html)
returns a block header, given its hash. The header data is returned as
a JSON object (`verbose=true`, default) or in raw hex form (`verbose=false`).

- The [REST interface](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md)
provides another way to query a `bitcoind` node. It's not enabled by default; specify the
`bitcoind -rest` command-line option or `rest=1` in the config file to enable this service.

- The REST interface also provides a
[blockheader](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md#blockheaders)
endpoint to fetch block headers; on mainnet, try:
```
curl -s localhost:8332/rest/headers/00000000000000000006c042058f7ff60003ae9a96ca2ac3065d91221b00f547.json
```
This returns five block headers beginning with the specified block hash. You can specify
the number of headers by appending `?count=nnn` to the URL.
The maximum number of results is 2000.

- This PR proposes to allow the `getblockheader` RPC to return more than one header by adding an
optional `count` argument, bringing it in line with the functionality offered in the REST interface.

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR?
[Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. The new `count` argument is placed after the `verbose` argument. Why?

1. Suppose you do not want to specify the `verbose` argument (that is, you prefer the default),
but you do want to specify `count`. Is there a way to do that?

1. Why is the type of the `count` argument an
[`RPCArg::Type::AMOUNT`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/053ccf0468e477283e80f78cc095ffb83bff9b95#diff-decae4be02fb8a47ab4557fe74a9cb853bdfa3ec0fa1b515c0a1e5de91f4ad0bR506)
rather than a `RPCArg::Type::NUM` as would seem more natural?

1. The default number of headers to return is 1, yet there is a difference
between specifying `count=1` and not specifying a count. What is this difference?
Why do these behave differently, and should they?

1. Why is the count limited to 2000? Do you agree with this limit?
What are the tradeoffs?

do? Why are the `Ensure*` family of functions often used in RPC handlers?

1. Why does the PR modify

What are the meanings of the values in the `vRPCConvertParams` table?

1. Does the `getblockheader` RPC work on a pruned node? Why or why not?
How does this compare with the `getblock` RPC?

1. Why is `getblockheader`'s block specification argument a hash instead of a height?
Related: How does the RPC determine the next header in the series (if more
than a single header is being returned)?
(Hint: how is

What happens if you specify a block hash that isn't part of the
active ("best") chain?
