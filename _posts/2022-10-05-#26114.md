## Notes

- Nodes connect to peers based on a set of addresses they know about, stored in their
  [`AddrMan`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f59e91511a3aa8b2770eeec7034ddc1a9dec918b/src/addrman.h#L86),
but a brand new node starts out with an empty AddrMan. In order to participate in the network, the
node needs to find addresses of peers to connect to.

- Care is taken to not create a bias in the source of addresses. For example, it would be
  inappropriate to have all new nodes connect to a list of 10 hard-coded addresses. That list of
nodes would become outdated very quickly, have an enormous burden of serving blocks to new nodes,
and be an eclipse vulnerability.

	- If the node's addrman is empty, it queries
[DNS seeds](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f59e91511a3aa8b2770eeec7034ddc1a9dec918b/src/chainparams.cpp#L118-L131)
run by community members.

	- If addrman is still empty, the node attempts connections to a set of fixed seeds,
	  hard-coded and updated once per release. You can read more about how the fixed seeds are
	  generated [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/contrib/seeds).

	- The node doesn't store addresses for
	  [unreachable](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1a369f006fd0bec373b95001ed84b480e852f191/src/net.h#L211)
	  networks. For example, if the node is only running on Tor, it won't add a clearnet address
	  to its AddrMan.

- Prior to [PR #26114](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26114), fixed seeds are added to
  AddrMan. This means the node's first outbound connections are likely all taken from the fixed seeds.

- An
  [AddrFetch](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/f59e91511a3aa8b2770eeec7034ddc1a9dec918b/src/node/connection_types.h#L70-L76)
connection is a temporary outbound connection, used specifically for soliciting addresses.

- The networking logic is multi-threaded (see list of threads and descriptions
  [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#threads)).

	- The `ThreadOpenConnections()` thread processes and sends messages to this node's peers.

	- The `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` thread makes connections to DNS seeds.

	- This PR also moves handling of fixed seeds from `ThreadOpenConnections` to
	  `ThreadDNSAddressSeed`, and renames the latter to `ThreadAddressSeed`. Note this is
	more involved than refactoring some code from one function to another; moving logic from one
	thread to another could mean that data structures previously accessed by one thread are now
	shared between multiple.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. Under what circumstances do we connect to the fixed seeds?

1. What observable behavior change does this PR introduce? What addresses do we add to `AddrMan`,
   and under what circumstances?

1. What is an AddrFetch connection and what is a full outbound connection? Why might we want to make
   an AddrFetch connection instead of full outbound connection to fixed seeds? Why might the node
operator behind a fixed seed prefer this as well?

1. The DNS seeds are expected to be responsive and serve up-to-date addresses of Bitcoin nodes. Why
   doesn't this help a `-onlynet=tor` node?

1. What does the `ThreadOpenConnections` do? What does `ThreadDNSAddressSeed` do? Which thread should
   handle connecting to fixed seeds, and why?

1. Why [wait 2
   minutes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/7e95f8f6bb0e06b0676db3da05b2a55a011c9668/src/net.cpp#L1560)
before adding the fixed seeds to AddrMan?
