title: "Track AddrMan totals by network and table, improve precision of adding fixed seeds"
pr: 26847
authors: [mzumsande]
components: ["p2p"]

status: upcoming

## Notes
- `AddrMan`, the in-memory database of peers, consists of two tables
(`new` and `tried`). `AddrMan` keeps count of the total number of addresses
in each of these two tables, but not on a per-network basis.
For example, it's currently not possible to directly query `AddrMan` if
it has any onion addresses in its `new` table, or how many of them.

- This PR adds internal tracking of the totals by network and table to `AddrMan`
and adds this information to its public interface.

- The added counts are then used to improve the precision of loading fixed seeds,
adding seeds of specific reachable networks we don't have any addresses for in a
targeted way.

- On a longer time frame, this is also a first preparatory step towards more active
management of outbound connections with respect to networks. One of the goals is
to always have at least one outbound connection to each reachable network.

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. When is a network
[`reachable`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ffc22b7d42c6360223508293b8c1f88b1a1a468b/src/net.cpp#L333) in Bitcoin Core?
(it's not as self-explanatory as it may seem!)

1. How are addresses relayed over the p2p network treated depending
on whether they are reachable vs. non-reachable - do we store them and/or
forward them to peers? (Hint: Look in [ProcessMessage](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ffc22b7d42c6360223508293b8c1f88b1a1a468b/src/net_processing.cpp#L3554))

1. How does this PR attempt to make sure that there are no bugs causing
the added counts per network to fall out of sync with other `AddrMan` internals
such as `nNew` and `nTried`?

1. How can a node currently get stuck with only unreachable addresses in `AddrMan`,
finding no outbound peers? How does this PR fix it?

1. Why would it be beneficial to have outbound connections to
all reachable networks at all time? Why is the current logic in
[`ThreadOpenConnections`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ffc22b7d42c6360223508293b8c1f88b1a1a468b/src/net.cpp#L1578)
insufficient to guarantee this?

1. What would be the possible next steps towards this goal after this PR?
