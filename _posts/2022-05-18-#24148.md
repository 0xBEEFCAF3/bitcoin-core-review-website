_Notes and questions to follow soon! Some preparatory resources have already been added._


## Notes

The following resources are quite helpful (in that order) to better understand the concepts of Output Descriptors and Miniscript.

- [Video: Andrew Chow on Native Descriptor Wallets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC25NzIjzog)
- [Video: Andrew Poelstra on Getting Started with Miniscript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTUuwASdUBE)
- [The Miniscript Homepage](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/)

You can also get a better feel of how Bitcoin Script, Miniscript (policy) and Output Descriptors interact on [https://min.sc/](https://min.sc/) by looking at the examples and constructing `Minsc` scripts yourself. *Note: `Minsc` is a scripting language on top of Miniscript policy, "with additional features and syntactic sugar sprinkled on top, including variables, functions, infix notation, human-readable times and more."*
