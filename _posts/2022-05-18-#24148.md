## Notes

### Scope

This is a 2-part Review Club. Since we haven't covered Miniscript before, we first take some time to get familiar with the general concepts before diving into the actual PR.

- In the [first part](https://bitcoincore.reviews/24148), we'll disregard output descriptors and look at Miniscript in general and some of the changes this PR introduces. We'll focus on the first 6 commits from "miniscript: remove a workaround for a GCC 4.8 bug" to "miniscript: split ValidSatisfactions from IsSane".

- In the [second part](https://bitcoincore.reviews/24148-2), we'll look at the Miniscript output descriptor implementation. We'll focus on the last 9 commits from "miniscript: tiny doc fixups" to "qa: functional test Miniscript watchonly support".

- Some of the questions refer to changes introduced in the PR's predecessor [#24147](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24147) which introduced the bulk of the Miniscript logic into Bitcoin Core, so it may be helpful to gloss over that PR too. It also contains a more detailed overview of the various PRs involved in merging Miniscript into the Bitcoin Core codebase.


### Introduction

- [Miniscript is](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) a language for writing (a subset of) Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way, enabling analysis, composition, generic signing and more. It is [not to be confused](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/91565/what-does-bitcoin-policy-language-offer-the-developer-that-miniscript-doesnt-w) with the policy language on top of Miniscript which looks similar to Miniscript, but is out of scope for this PR. Andrew Poelstra has a helpful video on ["Getting Started with Miniscript"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTUuwASdUBE).

- [Output script descriptors](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/output-script-descriptors/) are strings that contain all the information necessary to allow a wallet or other program to track payments made to or spent from a particular script or set of related scripts (i.e. an address or a set of related addresses such as in an HD wallet).

- Descriptors combine well with Miniscript in allowing a wallet to handle tracking and signing for a larger variety of scripts. Since [Bitcoin Core 23.0](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/23.0/) descriptor wallets have become the default wallet type.

- This PR [#24148](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24148) introduces watch-only support for Miniscript descriptors, extending the [already existing descriptor language](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md). You've probably noticed that both languages have very similar syntax, [this is intentional](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16800#issuecomment-583559190).


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. Which type of analysis enabled by Miniscript would be helpful for which use case or application?

1. What would be a valid Miniscript for a spending policy that unconditionally locks the UTXO for 21 blocks, and then requires a 2-of-3 multisig from Alice, Bob, or Carol? *(Note: the [Miniscript homepage](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) and [https://min.sc/](https://min.sc/) have easy-to-use tooling available to construct Miniscripts)*

1. What does it mean when a node is "sane" or "valid"? Do they mean the same thing?

1. What does it mean for an expression to be non-malleably satisfied? After SegWit, why do we still need to worry about malleability?

1. Why does [`Compare`](https://github.com/darosior/bitcoin/blob/ec72f351134bed229baaefc8ffaa1f72688c5435/src/script/miniscript.h#L445) now use a non-recursive algorithm, whereas previously the `Node::operator==` operator was recursive? What is the largest size that `queue` in `Compare` can ever grow?

1. How do we keep track of a [`Node`](https://github.com/darosior/bitcoin/blob/ec72f351134bed229baaefc8ffaa1f72688c5435/src/script/miniscript.h#L280)'s type and type properties? Why don't we just declare them as regular class members? Can we instantiate a `Node` with multiple type properties at once?

1. In your own words, how does [`Node::TreeEvalMaybe()`](https://github.com/darosior/bitcoin/blob/ec72f351134bed229baaefc8ffaa1f72688c5435/src/script/miniscript.h#L338) work?

1. In [`Node::CheckTimeLocksMix()`](https://github.com/darosior/bitcoin/blob/ec72f351134bed229baaefc8ffaa1f72688c5435/src/script/miniscript.h#L846), what is the type of `"k"_mst`? In your own words, what does the `<<` operator do here?

1. Why is [`Node<Key>`]((https://github.com/darosior/bitcoin/blob/ec72f351134bed229baaefc8ffaa1f72688c5435/src/script/miniscript.h#L280)) templated with `Key`? What type(s) do we expect `Key` to take?

1. Why is the Script size for a multi or thresh fragment depending on the value of the k threshold? https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1511c9efb40524615ed47cc4e38af0735d536575/src/script/miniscript.cpp#L265
