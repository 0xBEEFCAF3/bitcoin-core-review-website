## Notes

### Background

Please review [V3 and Package RBF Part 1](https://bitcoincore.reviews/25038) and [Part 2](https://bitcoincore.reviews/25038-2) for background info on the problem setting and proposed solution for RBF pinning.

The proposed Ephemeral Anchor BIP is hosted [here](https://github.com/instagibbs/bips/blob/ephemeral_anchor/bip-ephemeralanchors.mediawiki)

### Motivation

**Version 3** transactions solve the issue with what is commonly dubbed [BIP125 rule#3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki) pinning: A large, low fee-rate transaction enters the mempool, and becomes economically prohibitive to remove from the mempool via today's RBF rules. By limiting the size of a child transaction in a parent-child relationship to 1 KvB, we can bound this economic damage to a small multiple which depends upon what an "honest" CPFP'ing child transaction would look like given a users' wallet utxo makeup. In essence, it is a "RBF carveout" policy.

**Ephemeral anchors** are a special type of output that are watermarked(by policy only) via a short static output script. These are in turn with a few policy ground rules enable a new, more general "CPFP Carveout" which can sidestep *package limit pinning*. It also allows relaxation of output script requirements, increasing smart contract composability.

Lighting Network [BOLT03](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#commitment-transaction-outputs) for some "light" reading about how to avoid package limit pinning(poorly) with today's mempool policies. See `option_anchors` scripts, with `1 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP` as the canonical widget to avoid pinning.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?
1. What mechanisms do we have in place to discourage dust level utxos?
1. Are 0-value outputs consensus valid to create? How about in with standardness checks?
1. Are 0-value outputs consensus valid to spend? How about in with standardness checks?
1. Why does this PR rely on package relay?
1. Does this increase the risk of dust entering the utxo set? Can you think of any situations that might arise?
1. Why does this new output type use `OP_TRUE`?
1. What is today's [CPFP carve-out](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp-carve-out/) in Bitcoin Core? What are its limitations?
1. What benefits does this PR get from requiring V3 transactions? What properties of V3 does it rely on, if any?
1. What use cases does including an ephemeral anchor in a transaction help?
1. What use cases are it not helpful for?
1. Why are non-0 value outputs allowed to be Ephemeral Anchors?
1. Why not just watermark ephemeral anchors by being a dust output?

## Concrete Use-Case Questions

1. Why do anti-pinning measures in [BOLT03](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#commitment-transaction-outputs) appear suboptimal?
1. In what ways could BOLT03 be improved with Ephemeral Anchors?
