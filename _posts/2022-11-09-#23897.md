## Notes

- [BIP68](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki) introduced relative timelocks. They are relative to the block(s) in which this transaction's parent transaction(s) were mined. The timelock can be expressed as block height or time difference.

- Mempool policy [does not allow](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/50422b770a40f5fa964201d1e99fd6b5dc1653ca/src/validation.cpp#L782-L789) transactions that can not be mined in the next block because they're not BIP68-final.

- [`LockPoints`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/50422b770a40f5fa964201d1e99fd6b5dc1653ca/src/txmempool.h#L44-L54) are used to represent the block or time when a relative lock is satisfied. Since reorgs can affect when (or if) a transaction's input were confirmed, `LockPoints` can become invalid.

- [#23897](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23897) makes it easier to understand and reason about this code by separating the lockpoints calculation logic from the lockpoints validation logic.

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   
2. What is [`prevheights`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/ed2d714bd1130291a2f781e644f787d421cdf26e/src/validation.cpp#L193), and why do we need to calculate it?
   
3. What is the difference between [`CalculateSequenceLocks`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/50422b770a40f5fa964201d1e99fd6b5dc1653ca/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp#L39) and [`CalculateLockPointsAtTip`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/ed2d714bd1130291a2f781e644f787d421cdf26e/src/validation.cpp#L179-L181)? Are `LockPoints` and `SequenceLocks` the same thing, or how do they differ?
   
4. [`CalculateLockPointsAtTip`](https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/blob/ed2d714bd1130291a2f781e644f787d421cdf26e/src/validation.cpp#L179-L181) returns a `std::optional<LockPoints>`. Under which circumstance(s) will this be a `std::nullopt`? Do you see any alternative approaches?
   
5. What's the point of having `LockPoints::maxInputBlock` when we already have `LockPoints::height`?
   
6. Consider the function `CheckSequenceLocksAtTip`. Prior to this PR, is `LockPoints* lp` an [`in`, `out`, or `in,out` parameter](http://www.cs.ecu.edu/karl/2530/spr18/Notes/lec21A.html#logical-calling-modes:~:text=an%20implicit%20one.-,Logical%20calling%20modes,-Call%20by%20value)? What about after this PR?
   
7. How does this PR change the behaviour of `CheckSequenceLocksAtTip()`?
   
8. Which, if any, observable behaviour change does this PR introduce?
