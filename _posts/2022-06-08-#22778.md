## Notes

- Each of our node's peers is either inbound (our peer initiated the connection)
  or outbound (we initiated the connection).  Once the connection is
  established, the relationship is largely symmetric (the protocol works the same
  in both directions), although we treat outbound peers with some preference.

- When we initiate an outbound connection, we may decide that we won't
  relay (forward) transactions or addresses to this peer.
  This peer is designated a `block-relay-only` peer.
  This kind of peer connection was covered in earlier review club meetings
  (PRs [15759](https://bitcoincore.reviews/15759),
  [19858](https://bitcoincore.reviews/19858),
  [20726](https://bitcoincore.reviews/20726)).
  The peer
  doesn't know that we're treating it as `block-relay-only`.

- When connecting with a peer, we allocate a
  [`Peer`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1b2e1d179c5b350cac69ee670e01355314f25e11/src/net_processing.cpp#L203)
  object in the `net_processing` application layer (and a
  [`Cnode`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/e82d8069bcd0b05c3c12bfc2e1e63a82a8ca6290/src/net.h#L410)
  in the connection layer).
  If we plan to announce and send transactions and addresses to
  this peer (for example, if it's not a `block-relay-only` peer),
  we create an additional
  [`TxRelay`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1b2e1d179c5b350cac69ee670e01355314f25e11/src/net_processing.cpp#L250)
  struct object (owned by the `Peer` object) to track
  the state needed for relaying transactions to this peer.

- The `TxRelay` object includes:
   - the list of transactions we plan to announce to this peer
   - the rolling [bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) of
     transactions we expect the peer to know about (because either we sent the
     transaction to the peer, or it has sent it to us)
   - if we've enabled BIP37 (see below), the bloom filter sent by the peer

- If we advertise support for
  [BIP37](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/b1791c24aa163eb6578d0bfaadcf44997484eeaf/bip-0037.mediawiki)
  bloom filters to our peer
  during version handshake, the peer can send us a bloom filter
  after which we won't send transactions that aren't present in
  the filter (to reduce bandwidth).

- A node which initiates a connection may indicate that it doesn't want to
  receive transactions. It does this using the
  [`fRelay` field](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1b2e1d179c5b350cac69ee670e01355314f25e11/src/net_processing.cpp#L2703)
  in the
  [version](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1b2e1d179c5b350cac69ee670e01355314f25e11/src/net_processing.cpp#L2647)
  message.

- If we've advertised support for bloom filters to this peer,
  it may, at any time later, send us a `filterload` message,
  which has the side-effect of enabling transaction relay from
  us to this peer, even if it had sent `relay = false` in the `version`
  message.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. What's a bloom filter?

1. Why are some peers `block-relay-only`? Briefly, what's the purpose of having
   some peers being `block-relay-only`?

1. This PR reduces resource usage. Which resource is reduced and by how much?

1. Why is the
  [`TxRelay`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1b2e1d179c5b350cac69ee670e01355314f25e11/src/net_processing.cpp#L250)
  object separate from the
  [`Peer`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1b2e1d179c5b350cac69ee670e01355314f25e11/src/net_processing.cpp#L203)
  object?

1. Why is `NODE_BLOOM`
   [not the default behavior](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16152)
   (why does a node choose to advertise it, or not, using a service bit)?
   Why do most nodes apparently not enable this service?

1. Why would a peer send us `fRelay = false` in the version message?
   Why might a peer send us `fRelay = false` if it _wasn't_ planning to send
   us a `filterload`?

1. This PR is divided into four commits. What are some principles we
   should follow when deciding on how to distribute the changes
   among the commits?

**Bonus Questions**

1. This PR adds
   [`GetTxRelay()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22778/files#diff-6875de769e90cec84d2e8a9c1b962cdbcda44d870d42e4215827e599e11e90e3R292)
   to safely (using a mutex) return a pointer to a peer's `TxRelay`
   structure. If the a call to `GetTxRelay()` (for example,
   [this one](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22778/files#diff-6875de769e90cec84d2e8a9c1b962cdbcda44d870d42e4215827e599e11e90e3R1831-R1832))
   returns a non-null pointer, then the pointer is used without holding
   the mutex. What prevents the `TxRelay`
   structure from being deallocated just after the pointer to it is returned
   by `GetTxRelay()`, making the pointer invalid?

1. Some class variables are annotated `mutable`. What does this mean?
   _Hint:_ This is fairly common with mutex variables.

1. The pointer variable `tx_relay` is
   [initialized](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22778/files#diff-6875de769e90cec84d2e8a9c1b962cdbcda44d870d42e4215827e599e11e90e3R2767)
   as `const`, but it's used to mutate the `TxRelay` structure it's pointing to.
   How is that possible?
