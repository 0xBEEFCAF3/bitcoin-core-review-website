## Notes

- [#26036](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26036) introduced a new
  mutex (`NetEventsInterface::g_msgproc_mutex`) to document the fact that our
  message processing code is single threaded (`msghand` thread). Any
  `PeerManagerImpl` or `Peer` members that are only ever accessed from that
  single thread should be annotated as `GUARDED_BY(g_msgproc_mutex)`, to avoid
  bugs where those members are accessed by other threads as well (in which case
  they need to be guarded by a different mutex).

- `CNodeState` is documented to only have validation specific members and is
  therefore entirely guarded by `cs_main`. However, not all members are
  validation specific, and the ones that aren't should be moved to `Peer`.

- [#26140](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26140) is a simple refactor
  PR that moves some of the `CNodeState` members that are not validation
  relevant to `Peer` and annotates them as guarded by `g_msgproc_mutex`.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. What is `cs_main` and what is it used for?

3. Which threads access state relevant for message processing
   (`PeerManagerImpl`, `Peer`, etc.)? (Hint: have a look at the [developer
   notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/00eeb31c7660e2c28f189f77a6905dee946ef408/doc/developer-notes.md#threads)
   for a list of all threads)

4. What is the difference between `CNodeState` and `Peer`? How would you decide
   where to store new per-peer state? (Bonus points if you also mention `CNode`
   in your answer)

5. The PR moves `nUnconnectingHeaders`, `m_headers_sync_timeout`,
   `fPreferHeaders` and `m_recently_announced_invs` from `CNodeState` to
   `Peer`. Multiple other members of `CNodeState` are also not validation
   specific and should also move to `Peer`. Which members are that and why is
   it not as trivial to move those in comparison to the ones that this PR
   moves?

6. Why does the PR rename `nUnconnectingHeaders` and
   `MAX_UNCONNECTING_HEADERS`?
