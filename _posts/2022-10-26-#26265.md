## Notes

- Mempool policy
  [requires](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6d4048468430d9d1fe5e7c5fcda13708879d1083/src/validation.cpp#L699-L704)
that transactions be at least 85 bytes (non-witness size). This rule was introduced in PR
[#11423](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11423).
The original justification given was "A transaction with 1 segwit input and 1 P2WPKH output has
non-witness size of 85 bytes. Transactions smaller than this are not relayed to reduce unnecessary
malloc overhead."

- The true motivation was later documented as
  [CVE-2017-12842](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v55p-4chq-6grj) and PR
[#16885](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16885); a 64-byte
transaction could be used to [trick SPV
clients](https://bitslog.com/2018/06/09/leaf-node-weakness-in-bitcoin-merkle-tree-design/).

- While 64-byte transactions are nonstandard in Bitcoin Core, it is still possible to create one
  that is consensus-valid. It has been
[proposed](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-March/016714.html) in PR
#15482 to disallow transactions smaller than 65 bytes in consensus. This proposal has not been accepted.

- PR [#26265](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26265) relaxes the policy rule from 85-byte
  minimum to 65-byte minimum. Another approach could be to simply disallow 64-byte transactions.

- The author also
  [posted](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/020995.html)
this proposal to the mailing list, adding that a 65-byte minimum would allow
transactions with 1 input, 1 OP_RETURN output to be standard. Optech newsletters
[#99](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2020/05/27/#minimum-transaction-size-discussion) and
[#222](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2022/10/19/#minimum-relayable-transaction-size) have
discussed this topic.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. Why was the minimum transaction size 85 bytes? Can you describe the attack? Why does setting this
   policy help prevent the attack? Does it eliminate the attack vector entirely?

1. What does "non-witness size" mean, and why do we care about the "non-witness" distinction?

1. Why might we want to change the minimum transaction size to 65 bytes, apart from the fact that we
   no longer need to try to obfuscate the CVE outlined in the notes?

1. Between disallowing sizes less than 65 bytes and sizes equal to 64 bytes, which approach do you
   think is better and why? What are the different implications of both approaches?

1. What is "OP_RETURN padding"? What do 10, 9, and 41 represent in the calculation of
   [`MIN_PADDING`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/e5adc1a284a9292362e75501adc9f71ac6ecdf6e#diff-28d3b20588dcdd115f47a2c83254a9dcf413b6b6dbe5ad1833e922a042b0023eR34)?

1. What does the "tiny transaction" created
   [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/e5adc1a284a9292362e75501adc9f71ac6ecdf6e#diff-a99d72c0ed66c256169e92327e04ab223e71f5ef598e14aac0ff44dc2a1194daR348-R352) consist of?

1. What is the tiny transaction's size serialized *with* witness (Hint: see
   [`CTransaction`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6d4048468430d9d1fe5e7c5fcda13708879d1083/test/functional/test_framework/messages.py#L527)
   functions)?
