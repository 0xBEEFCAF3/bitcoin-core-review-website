## Notes

* User-Space, Statically Defined Tracing (USDT) allows observability into runtime internals at
  statically defined tracepoints. We have discussed USDTs at previous PR Review Club meetings,
[#22006](/22006) and [#23724](/23724).

* *Coin Selection* is the process of selecting UTXOs ("coins") from a wallet's UTXO pool in order to
  fund a transaction's payment(s). We have discussed coin selection at preview PR Review Club
meetings, including [#22009](/22009), [#17526](/17526) and [#17331](/17331).

* [PR #24644](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24644) adds tracepoints to the wallet's coin
  selection code.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
Did you test out the tracepoints?

2. What tracepoints does this PR add, and what information do they collect?

3. Why might we be interested in which algorithm was used and what the waste score is? How might we
use this information to improve coin selection?

4. Instead of instrumenting the coin selection code with tracepoints, why don't we just add logs?

5. What is a C-style string and why do the tracepoints pass this type of string?

6. What's the difference between the two calls to `CreateTransactionInternal`? What does it mean to
Avoid Partial Spends?

7. Under what circumstances is the coin selection algorithm labeled as "manual"?
