## Notes

- A new node automatically initializes and populates its data directory by performing
["Initial block download" (IBD)](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/106136/97099),
which is the process of fetching blocks
from peers and storing them in the `blocks` directory within the data directory
(default `$HOME/.bitcoin`). 

- The blocks are stored in files named `blknnnnn.dat` (for example, `blk01234.dat`).
These files are limited to 128 MiB, so each can hold about 60 blocks or
more depending on their sizes.

- The `blknnnnn.dat` files are not in any standard database format; their format
is quite simple: a sequence of blocks (their serializations), each preceded by
a 4-byte "marker" or "magic number" and a 4-byte integer indicating the block's
size or length in bytes. The blocks need not be in height-order, either within a
block file, or across block files. For example, block 2000 could be stored
in `blk00010.dat` while block 1500 could be stored in `blk00011.dat`.

- In order to save disk space, the node operator can enable a mode called
[_pruning_](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/37496/how-can-i-run-bitcoind-in-pruning-mode),
which retains only the most recent few hundred blocks on disk, although
IBD still downloads and verifies all blocks since the beginning.

- During IBD, besides storing the raw blocks, several kinds of state are derived from
the blocks and also stored the data directory, as entries in LevelDB. The two most prominent are
the block index and the chainstate (UTXO set). The
[block index](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5057adf22fc4c3593e1e633defeda96be508f198/src/chain.h#L150),
contains an entry for every block (not just unpruned blocks).
Each entry roughly corresponds to a block header (for example, it contains no transactions),
and also refers to the location (file and offset within the file) of the raw block corresponding
to this entry, if it hasn't been pruned away.

- If some type of corruption is suspected in the derived indices (the block index or
chainstate), the user has the option of starting over with an empty data directory,
and performing IBD again. But that's slow and uses a lot of network bandwidth.
If the node isn't pruned, an alternative is to start the node with the `-reindex` option.
This will use the existing blocks files to rebuild all the derived state.
It's simliar to IBD but obtains blocks from local files instead of network peers.

- PR 24858 fixes a long-standing bug that can cause a form of mild corruption
in the way blocks are stored within the blocks files following a reindex.

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. Which parts of the `bitcoind` data directory are not derived from other parts of
the data directory? What are some examples of parts that are?
<!-- blocks files are not derived, block index, txindex, chainstate are. -->

1. Why are blocks in the block files disordered?
<!-- Headers-first download https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/59933/97099
Blocks are stored in the order received (appending to one of the blocks files).
Since block download is parallelized (across peers), blocks can arrive out of order,
and hence stored on disk out of order -->

1. What is [`CBlockFileInfo`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a4e066af8573dcefb11dff120e1c09e8cf7f40c2/src/chain.h#L43) used for?
<!-- It maintains information about one blocks file. -->

1. What is reindexing, and how does it differ from IBD (initial block download)?
<!-- Reindexing sources blocks from local files, IBD sources from peers. -->

1. How does pruning interact with reindexing?
<!-- Reindexing isn't possible if pruning is enabled -->

1. What is the format of the `blknnnnn.dat` files?
Are these files portable across CPU architectures (big-endian, little-endian)?
<!-- Magic, length, block, ... -- yes, they are portable -->

1. What happens if a blocks file becomes corrupted?
Partial hint: See
[this call](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5057adf22fc4c3593e1e633defeda96be508f198/src/validation.cpp#L4281)
to [`FindByte`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/6dc3084eec912cf2abfe18d1c05655defaa45e20/src/streams.h#L726)
<!-- `LoadExternalBlockFile` recovers from the corruption by scanning forward
in the blocks file until it reaches the start of a block -->

1. Each network type (mainnet, testnet, signet, regtest) has its own "magic" bytes, for example,
[mainnet](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/623745ca74cf3f54b474dac106f5802b7929503f/src/chainparams.cpp#L102)).
Where else are these bytes used? Why do they differ across network types?
<!-- Used for network messages. Their purpose is to ensure that (for example) testnet
blocks files are not accidentally interpreted as mainnet blocks files. -->

1. What's the purpose of [the loop in `FindBlockPos()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/node/blockstorage.cpp#L593)?
<!-- Find a blocks file with sufficient space to add this block. -->

1. What bug does this PR purport to fix? Do you think it fixes it?

1. Did you [reproduce the problem](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24858#pullrequestreview-944897633) that this PR fixes?

1. A [review comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24858#discussion_r895769516)
suggested a slightly different way to fix the bug. Explain the
alternate approach. How does it compare?

Bonus question:

1. The definition of [BLOCK_SERIALIZATION_HEADER_SIZE](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24858/files#diff-ed3f90693a242b38b9719af171de8f55183576957676dfa358945bea22276bd5R48)
must be the same across platforms (so that the blocks files are portable).
Why is it okay to assume an `int` is 4 bytes? Couldn't it be different on some platforms?
