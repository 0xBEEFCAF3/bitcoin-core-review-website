## Notes

- Recommended reading from earlier review clubs:
  - [#16756: Connection eviction logic tests](/16756)
  - [#20477: Add unit testing of node eviction logic](/20477)

- Currently when connections are full, if we receive in inbound peer request, we look for a current connection to evict so the new peer can have a slot. To find an evict-able peer we go through all our peers and "protect" multiple categories of peers, then we evict the "worst" peer that is left unprotected. If there are no peers left to evict, the inbound connection is denied.
  
- With this PR, if the inbound connection is on our whitelist we still loop through all our current connection, removing protected peers from the evict-able list. However, now we keep track of the last peer we protected (aka the last peer we removed from the evict-able list). If we end up with no peers left to evict, the last protected peer is evicted instead. This should preserve the peer eviction logic but just in the case of a whitebind inbound, we evict the "worst best" connection.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. Why does this PR only apply to inbound peer requests?

1. What is the impact of the `force` parameter of [`SelectNodeToEvict()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/e71d495ffbda3bc072bbaecd7580809d5087f9e6/src/node/eviction.h#L42) on the return value?

1. In your own words, what is the mechanism by which [`ProtectEvictionCandidatesByRatio()`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/e71d495ffbda3bc072bbaecd7580809d5087f9e6/src/node/eviction.cpp#L112) protects a node from being evicted?

1. How is the function signature of [`EraseLastKElements`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/e71d495ffbda3bc072bbaecd7580809d5087f9e6/src/node/eviction.cpp#L78-L80) changed in this PR? Why is this necessary? Do you see an alternative approach?

1. In `SelectNodeToEvict()`, is the order in which we make the various `EraseLastKElements()` calls important? Why (not)?

1. `EraseLastKElements` used to be a templated function, but this is [changed in the first commit](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/bcc7e40aaf449484b1289ff0d139bed2f62ceeb8#diff-2404112ebf57bee5f9a16f1a6e1ecfc27a981d37a1c0ff202b4cd9bdfa3e48ccR75-R80). Why is this the case? Do you see any downsides to this change?

1. Suppose we pass a vector of 40 eviction candidates to `SelectNodeToEvict()`. Before and after this PR, what's the theoretical maximum of Tor nodes that can be protected from eviction?
