## Notes

- [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/) is the library that Bitcoin Core uses for low-level cryptographic operations such as signing and verification.

- This PR adds usage examples for several common use cases: ECDSA signatures, Schnorr signatures, and (elliptic curve) Diffie-Hellman key exchange. There are no existing usage examples in the library.

- The examples are intended to clarify the API by supplementing the documentation in the [various header files](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/tree/master/include).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
2. Can you compile and run the example? Note that the examples are not compiled by default. Therefore, you must run `./configure` with the `--enable-examples` arguments. Moreover, the ECDH and Schnorr signature examples are only compiled if the modules are enabled, which is done by providing the `--enable-module-ecdh` and `--enable-experimental --enable-module-schnorrsig` arguments to `./configure`.
3. Why do the examples demonstrate how to obtain randomness? Is this a good idea?
4. What are the recommendations for obtaining randomness on the supported operating systems?
5. Do the examples correctly follow these recommendations?
6. Can you follow the examples? Is it clear how they should be generalized to a production system?
7. Is there anything missing in the examples (e.g. [context_randomize](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/a5b5909e8d56eb3c23aeb6eb4cdca0a621a0930b/include/secp256k1.h#L749), [ec_seckey_verify](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/a5b5909e8d56eb3c23aeb6eb4cdca0a621a0930b/include/secp256k1.h#L593), return value check, setting secrets to 0, etc...)?
8. Are the comments in the examples helpful?
9. Are the comments sufficient (e.g. ECDSA takes message hash, not message)?
10. Is it a good idea to retry (in a loop) operations that could only fail with negligible probability (see [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/pull/748#pullrequestreview-404120824) for context)?
11. Is the build system correctly adjusted for the examples? Are examples disabled by default? Does the `configure` output show whether examples are enabled?

## Further Questions

These questions are intended to guide deeper exploration of libsecp256k1.
We may not have time to cover them in the review session, but they can help with above questions.

1. What's a [secp256k1_context](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/a5b5909e8d56eb3c23aeb6eb4cdca0a621a0930b/include/secp256k1.h#L27)? What role do they play in the API?
2. What does it mean for a context to be "initialized for signing" and/or "initialized for verification"?
3. What is the probability that [ec_seckey_verify](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/a5b5909e8d56eb3c23aeb6eb4cdca0a621a0930b/include/secp256k1.h#L593) fails given a uniformly random input byte string?
4. Can you give an example for a 33-byte string that results in failure when given to [ec_pubkey_parse](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/a5b5909e8d56eb3c23aeb6eb4cdca0a621a0930b/include/secp256k1.h#L343)?
5. Why doesn't [secp256k1_schnorrsig_sign](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/a5b5909e8d56eb3c23aeb6eb4cdca0a621a0930b/include/secp256k1_schnorrsig.h#L95) ask the user to generate a uniformly random nonce and pass it in?
6. What does it mean for a public key to be "X-only"? Why does the Schnorr example (unlike ECDSA) use "X-only" keys?
7. [secp256k1_schnorrsig_sign](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/a5b5909e8d56eb3c23aeb6eb4cdca0a621a0930b/include/secp256k1_schnorrsig.h#L95) takes a 32-byte message. What are two ways to use the API to sign longer messages?
8. Can you give an example for a 32-byte string that results in failure when given to [xonly_pubkey_parse](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/a5b5909e8d56eb3c23aeb6eb4cdca0a621a0930b/include/secp256k1_extrakeys.h#L37)?
9. What messages are actually exchanged (across the network) during an execution of the [ECDH protocol](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/a5b5909e8d56eb3c23aeb6eb4cdca0a621a0930b/include/secp256k1_ecdh.h#L36)?
10. What does ["randomizing"](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/a5b5909e8d56eb3c23aeb6eb4cdca0a621a0930b/include/secp256k1.h#L749) a [secp256k1_context](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/a5b5909e8d56eb3c23aeb6eb4cdca0a621a0930b/include/secp256k1.h#L27) do? How does that protect against side-channel attacks?
11. What does the `auxiliary_rand` argument to [secp256k1_schnorrsig_sign](https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/a5b5909e8d56eb3c23aeb6eb4cdca0a621a0930b/include/secp256k1_schnorrsig.h#L95) do?
12. How could an eavesdropping attacker detect whether two parties are engaging in an ECDH protocol?
