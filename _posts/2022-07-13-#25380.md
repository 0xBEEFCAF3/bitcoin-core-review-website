## Notes

- Fees for the wallet are calculated using a fee estimator attached to the node's mempool,
  [`CBlockPolicyEstimator`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/994573726f81afca5343e2a8d82309e697e61f90/src/policy/fees.h#L132).

    - At a high level, it records the feerate and time at which transactions enter the mempool and
      how many blocks later they confirm. Later, it uses this information to provide the opposite
      result: it provides a feerate estimate based on a given confirmation target (measured by how
      many blocks a user is willing to wait for their transaction to be included in a block).

    - To learn more about how the fee estimator works,
      [this article](https://johnnewbery.com/an-intro-to-bitcoin-core-fee-estimation/) and
      [this gist](https://gist.github.com/morcos/d3637f015bc4e607e1fd10d8351e9f41) are good places to start.
      Then, read the [comments](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/994573726f81afca5343e2a8d82309e697e61f90/src/policy/fees.h#L84-L130)
      in the source code and verify that the behavior matches the description!

- The
  [`estimatesmartfee`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/194710d8ff398838e4e5bb87b56e19ebed1d6c52/src/rpc/fees.cpp#L32) RPC provides feerate estimates based on the user's confirmation target.
  The test-only
[`estimaterawfee`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/194710d8ff398838e4e5bb87b56e19ebed1d6c52/src/rpc/fees.cpp#L106)
RPC provides more detailed information specific to the implementation.

- Since the fee estimator is data-based, it's crucial to accurately record what feerate a
  transaction is "offered" at. For example, if a transaction is fee-bumped using [Child Pays for
Parent (CPFP)](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp/), the parent's individual feerate would be an
underestimation and the child's would be an overestimation of their "actual" feerate.

- The fee estimator [skips transactions entering the mempool with unconfirmed
  inputs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b9f9ed4640f8064a0606755cd1f16ad5dbb0ee06/src/validation.cpp#L1072),
alleviating potential overestimation due to a high-feerate transaction sponsoring its ancestors.
However, since it's impossible to know whether a transaction will have unconfirmed descendants, a
low-feerate parent in a CPFP is still included. This means the fee estimator may underestimate feerates.

- One solution is to calculate a transaction's "actual" feerate, taking ancestors and descendants
  into consideration, (see [#23074](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23074)), but the
  calculation is not simple.

- [PR #25380](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25380) prevents the fee estimator from
  underestimating feerates due to inaccurately recording feerates for CPFP'd transactions.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. What issue does this PR address?

1. At a high level, how does the fee estimator work?

    (a) What information is recorded for new transactions entering the mempool? (Hint: what does
        [`mapMemPoolTxs`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/194710d8ff398838e4e5bb87b56e19ebed1d6c52/src/policy/fees.h#L258) store?)

    (b) What information is recorded for transactions in blocks? (Hint: see [`processBlockTx`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/194710d8ff398838e4e5bb87b56e19ebed1d6c52/src/policy/fees.cpp#L596))

    (c) Does the fee estimator track any transactions that are not in the mempool, were removed, or
        were mined but not in the mempool beforehand?

1. In this PR, how do we detect which transactions to drop? Do you agree with this approach? (Hint:
   see commit [`5485acf`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/5485acfe88051234a09862819ddc2953f9d42058)).

1. Why is the value for `totalunconfirmed`,
   [described](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/200a49f7e7197cfa5ba8b8123d3597e84eab0aa1/src/rpc/fees.cpp#L135) as a "number of txs," equal to 1.96

1. (Bonus) How would you modify the fee estimator to accurately account for CPFP fee-bumping?
