## Notes

* It is a [data race (undefined
  behavior)](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/memory_model#Threads_and_data_races)
  when a thread writes to memory that another thread is reading or writing.
  `std::mutex` and `std::atomic` can be used to guard against data races.

* Compilers such as gcc and clang can instrument the binary to detect data
  races with the flag
  [`-fsanitize=thread`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html).
  In Bitcoin Core it can be set via `./configure --with-sanitizers=thread`.

* However, data races may only happen intermittently and detection is not
  guaranteed, even if the program is fed the same inputs.

* In Bitcoin Core, validation code is protected by the `cs_main` global
  recursive mutex.

17:00 <MacroFake> hi everyone and welcome to today's review club 
17:00 <MacroFake> Let's give everyone a chance to say hi
17:00 <afmencken> hi
17:00 <paul_c> Hey everybody
17:00 <svav> Hi
17:00 <MacroFake> Anyone here for the first time?
17:01 <michaelfolkson> hi
17:02 <michaelfolkson> (ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
17:02 <michaelfolkson> clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation))
17:02 <michaelfolkson> ignore for now :)
17:02 <MacroFake> You also may indicate whether you reviewed the pull request (y/n)
17:02 <amirreza97> Hello, y
17:03 <paul_c> y
17:03 <jojo> hello, n
17:03 <MacroFake> Ok, let's jump right in with the first question.
17:03 <michaelfolkson> y
17:03 <afmencken> y
17:03 <Lov3r_Of_Bitcoin> y
17:03 <MacroFake> 2. Which two threads cause the data race fixed in this pull request? What is their purpose? Refer to the traceback in the pull request description.
17:04 <otech> y
17:05 <effexzi> Hi every1
17:05 <otech> is b-loadblk one of the threads?
17:05 <MacroFake> otech: yest
17:05 <MacroFake> *yes
17:05 <otech> cs_main is the other?
17:06 <MacroFake> cs_main is a Mutex, not a thread
17:06 <amirreza97> checking where the tip is null or not. The thread which starts at init.cpp
17:06 <amirreza97> whether*
17:07 <otech> Just called the "main" thread I guess
17:07 <MacroFake> Ok, so one thread is the b-loadblk thread, created at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/aeab1b42e67cc8146bfc7d127d15633bd652fe60/src/init.cpp#L1671 
17:07 <MacroFake> Another thread is the "main thread", created by the C++ main() "entry function" at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/aeab1b42e67cc8146bfc7d127d15633bd652fe60/src/bitcoind.cpp#L259
17:07 <MacroFake> What is the purpose of each thread?
17:07 <amirreza97> AppInitMain
17:08 <otech> Just FYI a list of documented threads can be found here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/developer-notes.md#threads
17:10 <amirreza97> I think the first one is to load blocks from blk???.dat files.
17:10 <MacroFake> amirreza97: correct. Also, it loads the mempoo.dat (if one exists)
17:11 <MacroFake> The main thread will run during the whole program duration, no fancy answer here :)
17:11 <michaelfolkson> "Responsible for starting up and shutting down the application" from otech's link
17:12 <MacroFake> 3. How is the data race fixed in the pull request? (Hint: First describe how it happens)
17:12 <amirreza97> So why these two starts at the same time? Isn't the first thread (reading from blk???.dat files) precondition for running the main thread?
17:13 <amirreza97> I mean reading from files is just at the first time AFAIK. So why not let it be finished and then start the main thread.
17:13 <MacroFake> amirreza97: The threads never start at the same time. loadblk is started by the main thread.
17:14 <amirreza97> So I mean simultaneously.
17:15 <MacroFake> As explained by michaelfolkson, main() will lead the init and shutdown process of the application.
17:16 <MacroFake> loading the blocks is one part of the init process. (Other things include loading the wallets and starting the net and p2p interfaces)
17:18 <MacroFake> Let's dissect question 3 a bit more. What is the call-stack (functions) for each thread where the race happens
17:18 <MacroFake> ?
17:19 <MacroFake> Hint: In the traceback in the pull reqeust description, this is included
17:20 <MacroFake> It is the first item in each line
17:20 <otech> Difficult to parse but something to do with `is_move_assignable` and `is_move_assignable` logic?
17:20 <MacroFake> We are looking at the sections "Write of size 8 ..." and "Previous read of size 8"
17:21 <otech> `is_move_constructible` *
17:21 <MacroFake> otech: Good point. Some function names are increadibly hard to parse as they include the full typenames
17:21 <MacroFake> We are only interested in the Bitcoin Core functions, not the std:: ones
17:22 <larryruane> modifying the chain tip (correctly, with cs_main): ActivateBestChain calls ActivateBestChainSetp calls ConnectTip calls SetTip ... reading the chain tip (without lock): AppInitMain calls ActiveTip calls Tip
17:22 <larryruane> (reading tip is being done to get the argument to RPCNotifyBlockChange)
17:23 <MacroFake> larryruane: Correct. The write happens here: "node::ThreadImport -> CChainState::ActivateBestChain -> CChainState::ActivateBestChainStep -> CChainState::ConnectTip -> CChain::SetTip"
17:24 <MacroFake> The read happens here: "main -> AppInit -> AppInitMain -> ChainstateManager::ActiveTip() -> CChain::Tip()"
17:24 <glozow> so the b-loadblk thread is writing in `SetTip()`while main thread is reading in `Tip()` ?
17:24 <MacroFake> glozow: Correct
17:25 <MacroFake> (Still with question 3), next step: Which lock is supposed to be held?
17:26 <paul_c> could we use a single mutex to remove the data race between the read from and write to?
17:26 <afmencken> cs_main is supposed to be held
17:26 <MacroFake> paul_c: Yes
17:26 <MacroFake> paul_c: The lock already exists, and is supposed to be cs_main
17:26 <MacroFake> afmencken: Correct
17:27 <MacroFake> (Still q 3), next step: Why is cs_main not held?
17:28 <MacroFake> Hint: The implemenation of ActiveTip: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/aeab1b42e67cc8146bfc7d127d15633bd652fe60/src/validation.h#L914-L918
17:29 <MacroFake> And the implementation of ActiveChainState: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/aeab1b42e67cc8146bfc7d127d15633bd652fe60/src/validation.cpp#L5157
17:29 <michaelfolkson> Why was cs_main not held before this PR? Is that the question, sorry
17:29 <larryruane> "Why is cs_main not held?" -- is it anything more than that it's an oversight? Ah I think I see, those first 3 methods you linked to don't scquire the lock
17:29 <glozow> cs_main is released at the end of `ActiveChainState()` ?
17:30 <MacroFake> michaelfolkson: Yes, that is the question
17:31 <michaelfolkson> Because it is held by a different thread?
17:31 <larryruane> (like `ActiveChainState` does... they should be similar in their locking behavior)
17:31 <MacroFake> glozow: Correct. The cs_main Mutex will only be held until the scope is closed. The scope in this case is the function body {...}
17:32 <MacroFake> michaelfolkson: If a mutex is acquired by a different thread, it can not be acquired by this thread. However, if the thread *wants* to acquire it, it will wait until it can
17:32 <lightlike> is there still a "race", just not one with UB? After the fix, loadblk still does its thing and possible changes the ActiveTip() several times, and at some point the main thread takes the cs_main and calls RPCNotifyBlockChange() with whatever is the current tip at this point - could that vary from run to run?
17:32 <MacroFake> michaelfolkson: If the thread does not want to acquire it, it will simply continue
17:33 <larryruane> ignore if this is too detailed, but "... it will wait until it can" -- does it spin-wait, or sleep-wait? Or spin for a short time and then "give up" and sleep (let other threads run)?
17:33 <MacroFake> lightlike: Good point. I think not, because RPCNotifyBlockChange doesn't care about the exact block, but I should double-check.
17:35 <MacroFake> larryruane: I am not familiar with low level primitives, but I'd guess that the thread will be put to sleep and woken when the lock is ready to be picked up
17:35 <sipa> larryruane: In Linux these days, locks are implemented using a mechanism called "futexes" (which have their own wikipedia article)
17:35 <larryruane> MacroFake: sipa: thanks
17:35 <MacroFake> (final part of q 3): How is the data race fixed in the pull request? 
17:36 <MacroFake> sipa: Thanks!
17:36 <sipa> IIRC the basic idea is to use atomic CPU instructions to quickly check if the lock is contended or not, and if it is, make a kernel call that gets woken up when needed
17:36 <larryruane> fixed by: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25077/files#diff-b1e19192258d83199d8adaa5ac31f067af98f63554bfdd679bd8e8073815e69dR1856
17:37 <larryruane> (holding cs_main while calling `ActiveTip`)
17:37 <sipa> (re futexes: ha, apparently rusty is listed as one of the inventors)
17:37 <michaelfolkson> Were people aware of this data race already (if they built with the thread sanitizer) or did you discover it through doing something specific MacroFake?
17:38 ‚Üê amirreza79 left (~Amirreza7@2.177.69.171): Leaving
17:38 <larryruane> i do see futex often in stack traces for idle threads 
17:38 <michaelfolkson> sipa: Lol
17:39 <MacroFake> michaelfolkson: Data races are had to reproduce, especially if they only happen once per process lifetime (init), so I try to keep an eye on intermittent failures
17:39 <MacroFake> This one was found by Cirrus CI on a completely unrelated change: https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5612886578954240?logs=ci#L4868 
17:40 <MacroFake> *hard to reproduce
17:41 <michaelfolkson> Intermittent build error messages or failing to build? (what you keep an eye on?)
17:41 <lightlike> Does the previous change in "AppInitMain" by this PR (before loadblk is started) also fix something, or is it a precautionary measure?
17:41 <MacroFake> michaelfolkson: The functional test fails
17:41 <michaelfolkson> Gotcha
17:41 <MacroFake> michaelfolkson: I copied the traceback from the Cirrus CI log
17:42 <MacroFake> ( Unrelated: A similar find was https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18742 )
17:42 <MacroFake> lightlike: Good question. I don't think it fixes anything as no other threads are running at this point
17:42 <MacroFake> (I think)
17:43 <MacroFake> Yes, you'll see that ThreadImport starts only 30 lines *later*
17:43 <MacroFake> However, I added annotations to the Active* function to force cs_main at every call site
17:43 <MacroFake> as belt-and-suspenders
17:44 <larryruane> it would be nice if there was a "race" or "thread-safety" PR label
17:44 <MacroFake> Ok, next question
17:44 <MacroFake> 4. What is the other issue fixed by the change? Why is it impossible to detect that issue with a thread sanitizer that detects data races?
17:45 <MacroFake> (hint: It is described in the pull request description)
17:45 <michaelfolkson> The corrupt REST response. Not sure how you found that either :)
17:45 <larryruane> maybe found by static analysis (annotations)?
17:45 <larryruane> it's not possible because that rest code is part of the client and it's single-threaded (?)
17:45 <larryruane> it's a separate executable
17:46 <MacroFake> michaelfolkson: I think it can only be found manually, unless there is a test that specifically checks this and for some reason fails
17:46 <michaelfolkson> So you just spotted it through your own eyes?
17:46 <MacroFake> larryruane: Nope. rest is delivered by the same bitcoind process
17:46 <larryruane> can we assert lock is held?
17:46 <larryruane> oh okay thanks
17:46 <MacroFake> michaelfolkson: Yes
17:47 <michaelfolkson> Wow ok
17:47 <larryruane> oh i was thinking of bitcoin-chainstate, that's a separate exe I think
17:47 <MacroFake> larryruane: Correct
17:47 <MacroFake> Anyone knows the answer to q 4? :)
17:48 <afmencken> In the case of the corrupt REST response, there is no data race to detect, is that correct?
17:48 <MacroFake> afmencken: Yes
17:49 <MacroFake> Hint: The REST interface calls chainman.ActiveChain().Height() and then chainman.ActiveChain().Tip()->GetBlockHash() separately 
17:50 <MacroFake> Hint: Is the cs_main lock held over both calls?
17:50 <afmencken> The problem is not that the lock isn't held, but that different pieces of data that the lock is guarding are read during different reads.
17:50 <afmencken> i.e. different "holdings" of the lock.
17:50 <afmencken> So the reads are inconsistent with eachother.
17:50 <MacroFake> afmencken: Correct
17:51 <paul_c> Is it impossible to detect that issue with a thread sanitizer that detects data races because it can't automatically find bugs in the program or suggest ways to fix the data-races found?
17:51 <MacroFake> paul_c: Hmmm. Think a bit more about what exactly a thread sanitizer detects
17:52 <MacroFake> Surely it detects "bugs in the program", but of what kind?
17:53 <larryruane> UBs, (undefined), like 2 threads reading and writing the same memory at the same time?
17:54 <larryruane> (or also, 2 threads writing) ... so not really locking? (but the fix is usually locking)
17:54 <MacroFake> larryruane: Yes, so getting the lock and getting thing_1, then releasing the lock, then taking it again and getting thing_2 is not UB (a data-race detectable by a sanitizer)
17:54 <lightlike> I think in this case there would be no UB, just a rest response that would consist of parts that don't fit together (because the parts correspond to different chain tips)
17:55 <MacroFake> lightlike: Yes
17:55 <MacroFake> I am not sure if a word exists for that. I just called it "logical" race
17:55 <MacroFake> 5. How is the ‚Äúlogical race‚Äù fixed in the pull request?
17:55 <larryruane> yes higher-level race, maybe
17:56 <larryruane> get the height and tip hash from within the lamba, while `cs_main` is held?
17:56 <afmencken> The logical race is fixed by moving all of the reads into a single critical section.
17:56 <MacroFake> larryruane: afmencken: Correct
17:56 <MacroFake> 4 minutes left for the last question and any of your questions
17:56 <larryruane> MacroFake: I was wondering if you considered returning those two values from the lambda?
17:56 <MacroFake> 6. Do you agree with the direction of the change to introduce a GetMutex() alias for the ::cs_main mutex?
17:57 <paul_c> y
17:57 <larryruane> yes! it paves the way for finer-grain locking (chainman level) instead of using cs_main for so much 
17:57 <MacroFake> larryruane: Yes, but that would mean more code
17:58 <MacroFake> larryruane: The lambda is called in two different places, but if the variables are set via capturing, then only one location would need to change
17:59 <larryruane> MacroFake: can you tell us why `::cs_main` instead of just `cs_main`? I know the double-colon means global scope, but is there a danger that some class will implement a `cs_main` variable? (Or do they already?)
17:59 <afmencken> I'm not sure I understand what is gained from adding GetMutex
17:59 <larryruane> is it just to emphasize that it's a global? (make it slightly uglier so we have more motivation to get rid of it? :) )
17:59 <MacroFake> larryruane: It doesn't matter fro ::cs_main, but for other globals that do not start with our g_ prefix (style guide), it could cause issues
