## Notes

This PR is the first step towards implementing [BIP352: Silent Payments](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458) in the Bitcoin Core wallet. BIP352 is "a protocol for static payment addresses in Bitcoin without on-chain linkability of payments or a need for on-chain notifications."

Before reviewing the PR, it is _strongly_ recommended that you read the [BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458), as well as the [reference implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bips/blob/cfe0771a0408a2d2de278d4e95bb9a33bd1615b2/bip-0352/reference.py) and [test vectors](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bips/blob/cfe0771a0408a2d2de278d4e95bb9a33bd1615b2/bip-0352/send_and_receive_test_vectors.json). This PR implements the logic from the BIP and is a child PR of [Silent Payments: send and receive](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27827).

1. [`CPubKey`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/56882622faf469b6f948f79a69c3c8ddbde92ff8/src/pubkey.h#L33) and [`CKey`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/56882622faf469b6f948f79a69c3c8ddbde92ff8/src/key.h#L32) are Bitcoin Core's classes for public and private keys. These classes handle serializing and deserializing key data and encapsulate `libsecp256k1` cryptographic operations. This PR adds new methods to these classes to support the cryptographic operations needed for BIP352.


1. [`CTxDestination`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/439e57aa88d33e9c61e4c38a37526133a79ab188/src/script/standard.h#L149) is a `std::variant` class used to represent a transaction output (or "destination"). This variant represents standard `scriptPubKey` templates and handles encoding and decoding outputs via the [`DestinationEncoder`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/439e57aa88d33e9c61e4c38a37526133a79ab188/src/key_io.cpp#L21) class and [`DecodeDestination`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/439e57aa88d33e9c61e4c38a37526133a79ab188/src/key_io.cpp#L81) function. BIP352 introduces a new output type which does not represent a single `scriptPubKey`, but instructions for generating a `scriptPubKey` using [ECDH](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/cfe0771a0408a2d2de278d4e95bb9a33bd1615b2/bip-0352.mediawiki#overview). This PR introduces new methods for encoding and decoding a silent payment address.

1. BIP352 has a [sending](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bips/blob/cfe0771a0408a2d2de278d4e95bb9a33bd1615b2/bip-0352.mediawiki#user-content-Sender) section and a [receiving](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bips/cfe0771a0408a2d2de278d4e95bb9a33bd1615b2/bip-0352.mediawiki#user-content-Receiver) section. This allows wallets to implement either half of the protocol without needing to implement the other. The logic for sending is implemented in the [`Sender`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/c75d9de0683a91151eb4a508cb64a8937ca92bdd/src/wallet/silentpayments.h#L41) class, with the bulk of the logic in the `GenerateRecipientScriptPubKeys()` method. Receiving is implented in the [`Recipient`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/c75d9de0683a91151eb4a508cb64a8937ca92bdd/src/wallet/silentpayments.h#L10) class, with the bulk of the logic in the `ScanTxOutputs` method. This PR only implements the BIP352 primitives and leaves the wallet implementation for a follow-up PR. As such, the interface for these classes is abstracted away from transactions and descriptors and instead works directly with `CPubKey`s and `CKey`s.

## Questions

1. Did you read the [BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458)? In a few sentences, can you summarize it in your own words?

1. Did you review the [reference implementation](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bips/blob/cfe0771a0408a2d2de278d4e95bb9a33bd1615b2/bip-0352/reference.py) and [test vectors](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bips/blob/cfe0771a0408a2d2de278d4e95bb9a33bd1615b2/bip-0352/send_and_receive_test_vectors.json)? Can you think of additional test cases?

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. In [5688262](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/56882622faf469b6f948f79a69c3c8ddbde92ff8), why do we need a custom hash function? Why not just use the default hash function from `libsecp256k1`? (hint: [see this discussion on the BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458#pullrequestreview-1466163601))

1. [ae6019b](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/ae6019b3a5f99e63b5f23e48fd430147b8500877) and [439e57a](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/439e57aa88d33e9c61e4c38a37526133a79ab188) add functions for decoding and encoding silent payment addresses. Why can't we just add silent payment addresses as a new `CTxDestination` variant and use the existing encoder class and decoder function?

1. [BIP352](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bips/cfe0771a0408a2d2de278d4e95bb9a33bd1615b2/bip-0352.mediawiki#versions) talks about about versioning and forward compatibility. Why is this important? Do you see any issues with the way the PR is written with respect to forwards compatibility (hint: look at the decoding logic in [ae6019b](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/ae6019b3a5f99e63b5f23e48fd430147b8500877))

1. In [`DecodeSilentAddress`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/ae6019b3a5f99e63b5f23e48fd430147b8500877#diff-a83ac7cb4a9d60b647db6378ccfad815005724e594bf53f49745b0f40701292fR327) there is a check on the version and data size. In your own words, can you explain what this check is doing? Why is it important?

1. The new Silent Payments code is under the wallet directory in [src/wallet/silentpayments.cpp](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2dedccebac504b6f3aea68cea6eb7537a16fd8ea/src/wallet/silentpayments.cpp). Is this a good place for the code to live? Why or why not? Can you think of use case where it would be better to have the code outside the wallet?

1. [`Recipient`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/2dedccebac504b6f3aea68cea6eb7537a16fd8ea/src/wallet/silentpayments.h) is a class which is initialized with two private keys, the scan key and the spend key. Are both of these keys necessary for scanning? Can you propose a better implementation? Which functions would you need to re-write? (hint: take a look at [`Recipient::ScanTxOutputs`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/2dedccebac504b6f3aea68cea6eb7537a16fd8ea#diff-44259d668fd117234d32cc93447c309aaeabcc780fdd38b1de6a187484040f8cR50)

1. Based on your answer above, what's one benefit for how the `Recipient` class is currently written?

1. In a few sentences, can you summarize what [`Recipient::ScanTxOutputs`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/2dedccebac504b6f3aea68cea6eb7537a16fd8ea#diff-44259d668fd117234d32cc93447c309aaeabcc780fdd38b1de6a187484040f8cR50) is doing?

1. In [`Sender::CreateOutput`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/2dedccebac504b6f3aea68cea6eb7537a16fd8ea#diff-44259d668fd117234d32cc93447c309aaeabcc780fdd38b1de6a187484040f8cR94), we hash the ECDH shared secret with an integer. Why do we need the integer counter?

1. Bitcoin Core has a [`HashWriter`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/2dedccebac504b6f3aea68cea6eb7537a16fd8ea/src/hash.h) class, which we use. Can you describe what this class does? For our usecase, we need to hash a public key (the shared secret) and an integer. The `HashWriter` provides a template function for hashing two objects: why not use this? Even better, why not hash the pubkey with the `<<` operator? (hint: look at how a `CPubKey` is serialized)

1. For the unit tests, we define an equality comparator as a "friendly" function. What is a "friendly" function? Does it make sense to use one here?
