## Notes

- The RPCs `fundrawtransaction`, `send`, `sendmany`, and `sendtoaddress` have
  `subtract_fee_from_outputs`, `subtractfeefrom`, and `subtractfeefromamount`
  arguments/options respectively. As these all implement the same behavior,
  we'll refer to them collectively as subtractfeefromamount (SFFA). For outputs
  marked with SFFA, the amount assigned to the recipient is reduced
  corresponding to the transaction's fee. If multiple outputs of a transaction
  are marked, the fee is split equally among them.

- The _effective value_ of a UTXO is the result of its value minus the fees
  necessary to spend it. The effective value therefore is dependent on the
  current fee rate and UTXOs with a low value will have a negative effective
  value at sufficiently high fee rates.

- [PR #17331](/17331) updated the wallet to use effective value in its coin
  selection. This allowed to use a fixed selection target calculated from the
  remaining parts of the transaction while inputs already had accounted for
  their own cost, whereas previously the selection was trying to hit a dynamic
  selection target as the fees needed to be amended to reflect the increasing
  count of inputs.

- Around the same time, the wallet's default behavior was updated to skip
  inputs with a negative effective value, under the assumption that users would
  prefer to defer usage of an input rather than paying more than its value for
  it to be spent.

- In concert, these changes
  [broke](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23026) an established
  pattern for emptying a wallet by calling `getbalance` and using
  `fundrawtransaction` with SFFA by specifying the full balance.

- After some attempts had been made to reconcile effective values with SFFA,
  [PR #24118](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24118) was proposed as
  an alternative solution. It allows users to send all UTXOs in the wallet.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. When would you use `sendall` and when SFFA?

1. A [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24118#issuecomment-1024920250) suggested that
   this RPC is potentially unsafe to have. Do you agree with this, and why?

1. Why are `send_max` and `inputs` exclusive options?

1. Why is `sendall` restricted to spend only confirmed UTXOs?

1. Why are there two ways of specifying recipients?

1. Looking at the cleanup decorator in the tests, can you guess where in the
   codebase `sendall` may find use?

1. How are the fee estimation instructions up for interpretation?
