## Notes

- The RPCs `fundrawtransaction`, `send`, `sendmany`, and `sendtoaddress` have
  `subtract_fee_from_outputs`, `subtractfeefrom`, and `subtractfeefromamount`
  arguments/options respectively. As these all implement the same behavior,
  we'll refer to them collectively as subtractfeefromamount (SFFA). For outputs
  marked with SFFA, the amount assigned to the recipient is reduced
  corresponding to the transaction's fee. If multiple outputs of a transaction
  are marked, the fee is split equally among them.
- The _effective value_ of a UTXO is the result of its value minus the fees
  necessary to spend it. The effective value therefore is dependent on the
  current fee rate and UTXOs with a low value will have a negative effective
  value at sufficiently high fee rates.
- Some time ago, the wallet was updated to use effective value in its coin
  selection. This allowed to use a fixed selection target calculated from the
  remaining parts of the transaction while inputs already had accounted for
  their own cost, whereas previously the selection was trying to hit a dynamic
  selection target as the fees needed to be amended to reflect the increasing
  count of inputs.
- Around the same time, the wallet's default behavior was updated to skip
  inputs with a negative effective value, under the assumption that users would
  prefer to defer usage of an input rather than paying more than its value for
  it to be spent.
- In concert, these changes
  [broke][https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/23026] an established
  pattern for emptying a wallet by calling `getbalance` and using
  `fundrawtransaction` with SFFA by specifying the full balance.
- After some attempts had been made to reconcile effective values with SFFA, a
  dedicated function to empty wallets promised to sidestep the issue
  altogether.


## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
1. How are the fee estimation instructions up for interpretation?
1. When would you use `sendall` and when SFFA?
1. A comment suggested that sweep is potentially unsafe to have. What's your
   take?
1. Why are `send_max` and `inputs` exclusive options?
1. Can you guess why `sendall` is restricted to spend only confirmed UTXOs?
1. Why are there two ways of specifying recipients?
1. Looking at the cleanup decorator in the tests, can you guess where in the
   codebase `sendall` may find use?
