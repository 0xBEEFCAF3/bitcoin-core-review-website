## Notes

- On startup, if a node's headers chain is more than a day behind the current
  time, it will pick one peer to sync headers with until its best headers chain
  is caught up. (See
  [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92f6461cfd39fff2fc885dd623fa47e7d8d53827/src/net_processing.cpp#L4889-L4913))
  If a node's headers chain is not caught up within `15 min + ~num headers
  missing * 1ms` (either because the chosen peer was not able to or because
  they purposefully stalled the download), it will
  [disconnect](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92f6461cfd39fff2fc885dd623fa47e7d8d53827/src/net_processing.cpp#L5223-L5254)
  the chosen peer for stalling and pick a new peer to sync headers with. Blocks
  are only downloaded and validated after the node's headers chain has
  sufficient work (`nMinimumChainWork`) to protect against DoS attacks.

- When a node
  [receives](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92f6461cfd39fff2fc885dd623fa47e7d8d53827/src/net_processing.cpp#L3236-L3248)
  a block announcement via an `inv` during headers sync, it will
  [add](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/92f6461cfd39fff2fc885dd623fa47e7d8d53827/src/net_processing.cpp#L3268-L3274)
  all announcing peers as additional headers sync peers.  [PR
  #25720](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25720) changes this logic
  such that only one of the announcing peers is added for headers sync.

- [BIP 130](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0130.mediawiki)
  (implemented in [PR #7129](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7129))
  introduced the `sendheaders` message, which indicates that a node prefers
  receiving block announcements via a `headers` message rather than an `inv`.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

2. Why do nodes (mostly) receive `inv` block announcements while they are doing
   initial headers sync, even though they indicated preference for `headers`
   announcements (BIP 130)?

3. Why is bandwidth wasted (during initial headers sync) by adding all peers
   that announce a block to us via an `inv` as headers sync peers?

4. What would be your estimate (lower/upper bound) of how much bandwidth is
   wasted? (There is no one true answer here, the estimate depends on a couple
   of variables)

5. What's the purpose of `CNodeState`'s members fSyncStarted and
   `m_headers_sync_timeout`, and `PeerManagerImpl::nSyncStarted`? If we start
   syncing headers with peers that announce a block to us via an `inv`, why do
   we not increase `nSyncStarted` and set `fSyncStarted = true` and update
   `m_headers_sync_timeout`?

6. An alternative to the approach taken in the PR would be to add an additional
   headers sync peer after a timeout (fixed or random). What is the benefit of
   the approach taken in the PR over this alternative?

7. Can you think of any other alternatives?
