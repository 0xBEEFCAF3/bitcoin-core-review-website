title: "Open p2p connections to nodes that listen on non-default ports"
pr: 23542

## Notes
* Bitcoin Core uses port 8333 as the default port on mainnet (18333 on testnet).
This means that nodes will listen on the default port for incoming connections,
unless another port is specified using the `-port` or `-bind`
startup options.

* However, nodes that listen on non-standard ports are unlikely to receive incoming
connections, because the automatic connection logic disfavors these addresses heavily.

* In preparation for this PR, [PR #23306](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23306)
changed the address manager behavior such that an addrman entry is now defined
by both IP and port, so that multiple entries with different ports and the same
IP can coexist.

* This PR changes the logic for automatic outgoing connections by dropping the preferential
treatment for the default port. It doesn't treat all ports as equal though:
A list of "bad ports" is introduced that are still disfavored for outgoing connections.

* Later commits also adjust the address gossip relay logic to include the port
of an address in a hash that is used to determine which peers to relay an
address to.

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. What were the historical reasons for the preferential treatment of the default port?

1. What are the benefits of removing this preferential treatment with this PR?

1.  Before this change, automatic connections to peers listening on non-default ports
were discouraged, but not impossible. Under what circumstances would a node still
connect to such a peer?

1. After this PR, the default port still plays a role in bitcoin core. Where is it
still used? Should it be a long-term goal to abandon the notion of a default port
entirely?

1. The PR introduces a list of "bad ports" that was taken from internet browsers.
Do you agree with having a list like this in general?
Are there any reasons to deviate from the list used by browsers?

1.  What is the reason for allowing callers to pass salts to `CServiceHash` and
then initializing it with `CServiceHash(0, 0)` in commit
[d0abce9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23542/commits/d0abce9a50dd4f507e3a30348eabffb7552471d5)?
