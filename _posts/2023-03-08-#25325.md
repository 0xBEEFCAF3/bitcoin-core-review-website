## Notes

- A pool-based resource is a resource that is pre-allocated and managed
   by a pool.

- A pool-based resource is typically a limited or expensive resource,
   such as a database connection, thread, or memory buffer. The pool keeps a
   number of pre-allocated resources ready for use, so that when a program
   requests a resource, it can be quickly and efficiently provided from
   the pool.

- When a resource user is finished using a pool-based resource, it returns
   it to the pool rather than releasing it back to the system. This means
   that the resource can be reused by another request without
   the overhead of allocating a new resource.

- (From the PR description:)
   This PR implements a memory resource similar to
   [`std::pmr::unsynchronized_pool_resource`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unsynchronized_pool_resource),
   but optimized for node-based containers. The goal is to be able to cache
   more coins with the same memory usage, and allocate/deallocate faster.

- The Bitcoin Core client, `bitcoind`, spends a large fraction of its
   time validating transactions. 

- We validate a transaction when we receive it over the P2P network,
   before adding it to our mempool; and also when we receive it in a new block,
   if we haven't already validated it (not already in our mempool).

- An important part of validating a transaction is ensuring that
   each of its inputs refers (using a
   [`COutPoint`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3b88c8502534f0dc94e0abcb04ffa80ba8bd7f01/src/primitives/transaction.h#L35))
   to an existing transaction output, and that this output is unspent.

- The speed of validating transactions critically depends on how
   quickly we can locate the UTXOs referred to by their inputs.

- When a transaction is confirmed, the UTXOs its inputs refer to become
   spent, and must be removed from the UTXO set. The transaction's
   outputs create new UTXOs which must be added to the UTXO set.
   So the UTXO set is modified very often, especially during
   Initial Block Download (IBD), when almost all we're doing
   is validating transactions as we receive each historical block.
   
- The entire UTXO set is stored on
   disk in the `chainstate` subdirectory of the data directory,
   in LevelDB format. Since
   reading from disk is orders of magnitude slower than reading from
   memory, we would like to have the UTXOs that we're most likely
   to need to access cached in memory.

- This UTXO cache, also called the _coins cache_, is one of the most
    memory-intensive data structures in Bitcoin Core. Its CPU
    performance is also important, both for lookup, and for
    modification since entries are added to and deleted from
    this cache at a high rate.

- The size of this memory cache can be controlled using the
   [`-dbcache`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2b465195e09a9cee2e712e5aa80eb95e89ec285c/doc/reduce-memory.md#in-memory-caches)
   configuration setting.

- A memory-resident unspent transaction output, UTXO, is represented in
   the codebase as a
   [`Coin`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3b88c8502534f0dc94e0abcb04ffa80ba8bd7f01/src/coins.h#L30) object.
   The key information in a `Coin` is a
   [`CTxOut`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3b88c8502534f0dc94e0abcb04ffa80ba8bd7f01/src/primitives/transaction.h#L157),
   which contains an amount (`nValue`) and a `scriptPubKey`, sometimes referred
   to as the _locking script_ because it prevents the coin from being
   spent without the authorizing witness as an input in a later transaction.

- For inclusion in the coins cache, each `Coin` is wrapped within
   a `CCoinsCacheEntry`(https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8126551d54ffd290ed5767248be4b3d19243787b/src/coins.h#L103)

- The coins cache itself, containing the individual `CCoinsCacheEntry`
   items, is implemented as a `std::unordered_map` container with the alias name
   [`CCoinsMap`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8126551d54ffd290ed5767248be4b3d19243787b/src/coins.h#L134).
   This map is part of the
   [`CCoinsViewCache`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8126551d54ffd290ed5767248be4b3d19243787b/src/coins.h#L223)
   class.

- To summarize, we'd like this `CCoinsMap` (unordered map) to have the
   minimum memory requirement and the highest possible performance.
   Reducing its memory requirement means that it can store more entries
   (UTXOs) within a given amount of physical memory, which increases the
   cache hit rate.

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
What was your review approach?

1. At a high level, what is the goal of this PR?

1. Why is
   [`CCoinsMap`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8126551d54ffd290ed5767248be4b3d19243787b/src/coins.h#L134)
   implemented as an `std::unordered_map` used instead of a `std::map`?
   What are the advantages of each?

1. How does the PR change the implementation of
   [`CCoinsMap`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/d87cb99bb37637e26a9e00b9f7de4bc6f44cb79d#diff-095ce1081a930998a10b37358fae5499ac47f8cb6f25f5df5d88e920a54e0341L134)?

1. Regarding [`class PoolResource`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/45508ec799a1206fc43f83a40ac7db975360ed29#diff-95c977c931cf8ed9a073043116ea5d223f6943eed5755c977e9171f7e801e3b2R70)
  - What does the `final` keyword do? Why is it needed here?
  - What does `static_assert` do? Why is it used here instead of a regular assert?
  - What does the expression `(ALIGN_BYTES & (ALIGN_BYTES - 1)) == 0` do?
  - Why is this class templated by `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE_BYTES` and `ALIGN_BYTES`,
  - Why do some methods specify the `[[nodiscard]]` attribute?

1. The [`PoolResource`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/45508ec799a1206fc43f83a40ac7db975360ed29#diff-95c977c931cf8ed9a073043116ea5d223f6943eed5755c977e9171f7e801e3b2R177)
   takes one argument, `chunk_size_bytes`. What does this argument do, and
   what are the tradeoffs when deciding on this value?

1. Why is this allocator faster (for the coins cache) than the standard allocator?

1. Why does this allocator use less memory (for the coins cache) than the standard allocator?

1. Can you think of a usage pattern (perhaps outside of the coins cache) that might
   cause this allocator to use more memory than the standard allocator?

1. Are there other data structures that can take advantage of this new allocator?
