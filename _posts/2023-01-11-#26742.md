## Notes

- First, we'll have a more general look at Bitcoin Core's HTTP server to build an essential understanding of the area we're working on. Then we'll dive deeper into the specifics of this PR.

### HTTP server

- Since [#5677](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5677), Bitcoin Core's [HTTP server](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/adc41cf3b22f8f168e88ce3ad5f27c1130f12beb/src/httpserver.cpp#L138-L139) is based on [libevent2](https://libevent.org/). Libevent is a general purpose event notification library, but is used in Bitcoin Core specifically for HTTP requests (which it supports natively).

- Much (not all) of the libevent interface is hidden behind wrappers. For example, [`HTTPRequest`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/296e88225096125b08665b97715c5b8ebb1d28ec/src/httpserver.h#L56) wraps `evhttp_request` and [`HTTPEvent`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/296e88225096125b08665b97715c5b8ebb1d28ec/src/httpserver.h#L154) wraps [`event_base`](https://libevent.org/doc/structevent__base.html)

- The relevant workflow for how (for example) an RPC request is handled is roughly as follows:

  1. the HTTP server receives an RPC command from a caller, creates an `evhttp_request` object and passes its pointer to `http_request_cb()` (this step is completely handled by libevent)

  2. an `HTTPWorkItem` is [created](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/adc41cf3b22f8f168e88ce3ad5f27c1130f12beb/src/httpserver.cpp#L261), containing the `evhttp_request` (wrapped in `HTTPRequest hreq`) as well as the path and reference to the handler function (which contains the business logic to be executed to deal with the request)

  3. the `HTTPWorkItem` [is put on the global](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/adc41cf3b22f8f168e88ce3ad5f27c1130f12beb/src/httpserver.cpp#L263) `WorkQueue g_work_queue`, which [is processed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/adc41cf3b22f8f168e88ce3ad5f27c1130f12beb/src/httpserver.cpp#L336-L341) by multiple worker threads asynchronously

  4. when the handler function of a `HTTPWorkItem` completes successfully, it calls [`HTTPRequest::WriteReply()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/adc41cf3b22f8f168e88ce3ad5f27c1130f12beb/src/httprpc.cpp#L230), which triggers the libevent function [`evhttp_send_reply()`](https://libevent.org/doc/http_8h.html#a0a77d07263e20733a7562dcd576ad721), which in turn returns a response to the caller and destroys the `evhttp_request` object.

- Endpoints are registered to the HTTP server by calling `RegisterHTTPHandler()`, such as e.g. in [`StartHTTPRPC()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/adc41cf3b22f8f168e88ce3ad5f27c1130f12beb/src/httprpc.cpp#L301-L303)

- The HTTP server is initiated and started from `AppInitServers()`, and stopped from `Shutdown()`

- `StartHTTPServer()` [adds](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/adc41cf3b22f8f168e88ce3ad5f27c1130f12beb/src/httpserver.cpp#L430) a thread for each worker to `g_thread_http_workers`. These threads will keep running until [`WorkQueue::Interrupt()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/adc41cf3b22f8f168e88ce3ad5f27c1130f12beb/src/httpserver.cpp#L118) sets `running` to `false` and [the queue is empty](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/adc41cf3b22f8f168e88ce3ad5f27c1130f12beb/src/httpserver.cpp#L106).

### This PR

- This PR changes `StopHTTPServer()` to destroy the `eventHTTP` HTTP server (by calling `evhttp_free(eventHTTP`)) as soon as all workers have finished executing their tasks, making the shutdown process significantly faster.

- Libevent [requires](https://github.com/libevent/libevent/blob/1cea01d6d5c84337dac663e5464059ccd2d6a8dd/include/event2/http.h#L208-L217) that no requests are being served when `evhttp_free()` is called, so we keep track of all the requests created by libevent that have not yet been completed in `g_requests`.

- The change is unlikely to be significant to users, since node shutdowns are typically not very frequent. It does however significantly speed up (verify this yourself!) the `feature_abortnode.py` functional test, consequently speeding up developer workflows *worldwide*.

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. Which of Bitcoin Core's interface(s) (RPC, REST, ZMQ) make use of the HTTP server? For each interface, how many handlers are registered to `pathHandlers`?

1. We [already wait](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/cc663803d363b974baee17337608843d038ccda2#diff-63c8cb9c9dd61d50d59afd5c39914e1c259f8743030b637a7896a0746c851ef1R467-R473) for all threads in `g_thread_http_workers` to be joined before destroying `eventHTTP`, which only happens when the queue is empty (see notes) - so we would expect all requests to be handled by then. Why do we separately need to track `evhttp_request` objects, too?

1. What's the purpose of `g_requests`? Can you think of any alternative approaches that would achieve the same goal?

1. Which (smallest possible) part of the code change in this PR is responsible for the drastic performance speedup in `feature_abortnode.py`, and why is that making it faster?

1. What is a `GlobalMutex`, and why is it used here?

1. What does the `EV_TIMEOUT` passed to `event_base_once()` mean, and why is it used here?

1. (Bonus): why do we have both a `StartRPC()` as well as a `StartHTTPRPC()` function?
