## Notes

- Bitcoin relies on the concept of time for operations such as the difficulty adjustment and transaction- or script-level timelocks. Since time is relative and clocks are notoriously difficult to keep synchronized, it is impossible to define a source of truth that does not depend on synchronization and authorities such as NTP servers. In a decentralized system, we must accept that nodes can have a different but equally valid view of the current time.

- The Bitcoin network comes to consensus on time by requiring miners to commit to a timestamp in the [block header](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch09.asciidoc#block-header). To prevent miners from being able to use excessively deviating timestamps in their blocks, nodes [verify](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3a0f54dd2402d74a5ac4304b3ad09014cfb25edf/src/validation.cpp#L3803-L3810) that the timestamp is later than the `Median Time Past` (calculated on the previous 11 blocks), and earlier than 2 hours from the current time.

- Prior to this PR, the current time was calculated based on the network-adjusted time. When connecting to a peer, the peer's current time is compared to the system's current time, and the time difference is [stored](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3a0f54dd2402d74a5ac4304b3ad09014cfb25edf/src/net_processing.cpp#L3556). The network-adjusted time is then calculated by adding the median of all peers' offsets to the system's current time, unless it exceeds the `-maxtimeadjustment` value [in which case a warning is emitted](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3a0f54dd2402d74a5ac4304b3ad09014cfb25edf/src/timedata.cpp#L84-L100).

- With this PR, the upper bound of the validity of a block header's timestamp is no longer calculated based on the network-adjusted time, but on the unadjusted system's current time. The network-adjusted time is still calculated and used to warn users of a potential clock misconfiguration.

- Note: the description in `timedata.cpp` [mentions that](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3a0f54dd2402d74a5ac4304b3ad09014cfb25edf/src/timedata.cpp#L66-L68) "the condition to update nTimeOffset includes checking whether the number of elements in vTimeOffsets is odd, which will never happen after there are 200 elements.". This comment has become outdated since [#6545](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6545), which made the maximum number of elements explicit in an earlier check.


## Questions

### Concept

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

2. Is it necessary for block headers to have a timestamp? If so, why?

3. What is the difference between Median Time Past (MTP) and network-adjusted time? Which of these are relevant to the PR?

4. Why are limits enforced on how far "off" a block header's timestamp is allowed to be from a node's internal clock? And since we don't require exact agreement on time, can these limits be made more strict?

5. Prior to this PR, why would an attacker try to manipulate a node's network-adjusted time?

6. Prior to this PR, how could an attacker try to manipulate a node's network-adjusted time? Which network message(s) would they use? *Hint: network messages are processed in `net_processing.cpp`*

7. Does this PR remove any attack vectors? Does it introduce new ones?

8. Does this PR change consensus behaviour? If so, is this a soft fork, a hard fork, or neither? Why?

9.  After this PR, does it still matter for a non-mining node to have its system time (roughly) agree with that of the network? Why (not)?

### Code
{:start="10"}

1.  Which operations were relying on network-adjusted time prior to this PR?

2.  Does this PR introduce any difference in how and when it warns for a clock that appears out-of-sync with the network?

3.  `TimeOffsets` [has a size of `199`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/dde4e1c6b0cbb49b84e75b9d0d1a92161ba5a499#diff-6875de769e90cec84d2e8a9c1b962cdbcda44d870d42e4215827e599e11e90e3R193), but `CMedianFilter` [was initialized](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3a0f54dd2402d74a5ac4304b3ad09014cfb25edf/src/timedata.cpp#L41-L44) with a size of `200`. What explains this difference?

4.  Which of the values {0, 5, -2, 50s, 70m} are valid inputs for `-maxtimeadjustment`?

5.  `CMedianFilter` internally [used two `std::vector`s](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/3a0f54dd2402d74a5ac4304b3ad09014cfb25edf/src/timedata.h#L28-L29), whereas `TimeOffsets` [uses a single `std::array`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/3a0f54dd2402d74a5ac4304b3ad09014cfb25edf/src/net_processing.cpp#L196). What do you see as the trade-offs between these approaches?

6.  [Commit eee4c32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/eee4c32b4568d7347ca0db424a620bb71d451af3#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98L2196-L2199) removes a comment about not checking again for the 2-hours-in-the-future rule. Can and/or should this check now be introduced here?
