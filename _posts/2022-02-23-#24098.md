## Notes

This PR is a followup to #17631, which we discussed in a [previous review club](/17631).

### PR description

In RESTful APIs, [typically](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/parameters/query/) path
parameters  (e.g. `/some/unique/resource/`) are used to represent resources, and query parameters
(e.g. `?sort=asc`) are used to control how these resources are being loaded through e.g. sorting,
pagination, filtering, etc.

As first [discussed in #17631](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17631#discussion_r733031180),
the [current REST api](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md)
contains two endpoints `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` that rather unexpectedly use path
parameters to control how many (filter) headers are returned in the response. While this is no
critical issue, it is unintuitive and we are still early enough to easily phase this behaviour out
and ensure new endpoints (if any) do not have to stick to non-standard behaviour just for internal
consistency.

In this PR, a new `HTTPRequest::GetQueryParameter` method is introduced to easily parse query
parameters, as well as two new `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints that use a count
query parameter are introduced. The old path parameter-based endpoints are kept without too much
overhead, but the documentation now points to the new query parameter-based endpoints as the default
interface to encourage standardness.

The `COUNT` parameter controls how many
[headers](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr24098/doc/REST-interface.md#blockheaders)
or
[blockfilterheaders](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr24098/doc/REST-interface.md#blockfilter-headers)
are returned for a single API request, and defaults to 5 if unspecified.

### Using the REST API

We'll test the [REST
API](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/pr24098/doc/REST-interface.md) on
signet. To do so, first start a bitcoind instance with the `-rest` flag enabled. To use the
`blockfilterheaders` endpoint, you'll also need to set `-blockfilterindex=1`: `./bitcoind -signet
-rest -blockfilterindex=1`

As soon as bitcoind is fully up and running, you should be able to query the API, for example by
using curl on the command line: `curl "127.0.0.1:38332/rest/chaininfo.json"` As a response, you
should get:
```
{"chain":"signet","blocks":78071,"headers":78071,"bestblockhash":"000000b3e98c0de440154f42819b56586ed36bad0baa2db8ba5d0950e416dcad","difficulty":0.002873067874458486,"time":1645188967,"mediantime":1645188099,"verificationprogress":0.9999934105995945,"initialblockdownload":false,"chainwork":"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dc187f6fa0","size_on_disk":373918704,"pruned":false,"softforks":{"bip34":{"type":"buried","active":true,"height":1},"bip66":{"type":"buried","active":true,"height":1},"bip65":{"type":"buried","active":true,"height":1},"csv":{"type":"buried","active":true,"height":1},"segwit":{"type":"buried","active":true,"height":1},"taproot":{"type":"bip9","bip9":{"status":"active","start_time":-1,"timeout":9223372036854775807,"since":0,"min_activation_height":0},"height":0,"active":true}},"warnings":"This is a pre-release test build - use at your own risk - do not use for mining or merchant applications"}

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. In HTTP requests, what is the difference between a `path` and a `query` parameter?

1. What are the **benefits** of changing the `COUNT` parameter from a `path` parameter to a `query`
   parameter?

1. What are the **drawbacks** of changing the `COUNT` parameter from a `path` parameter to a `query`
   parameter?

1. *(general discussion)* If the effort of implementing a change is already done, what could be some
   good reasons for rejecting an (unharmful) code change anyway? Do you (dis)agree with [this
comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24098#pullrequestreview-860377099)?

1. Does this PR change any of the existing function signatures? If so, why? Can this cause any
   behaviour change?

1. Can you list all the commits that introduce behaviour change(s)? Do you feel comfortable about
   these behaviour change(s)?

1. Consider the request (signet) `GET
   /rest/blockfilterheaders/basic/2/0000004c6aad0c89c1c060e8e116dcd849e0554935cd78ff9c6a398abeac6eda.json?count=1`.
   What would the response be prior to this PR? What would the response be after this PR? Which
   (modified) function is responsible for this behaviour change? Try reasoning about it before
   verifying experimentally.

1. One reviewer [raises](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24098#issuecomment-1027755825) the
   view that `/rest/headers/` is a collection endpoint instead of a single resource endpoint. Do you
   agree? If so, would you change the PR to implement this? What would be the drawbacks of doing that?

1. Why does this PR introduce both
   [HTTPRequest::GetQueryParameter](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/6628e8f3b0578ec09611c82011dd2e282ed42064/src/httpserver.h#L96)
   and
   [GetQueryParameterFromUri](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/blob/6628e8f3b0578ec09611c82011dd2e282ed42064/src/httpserver.h#L142)?
   Couldn't we just put all the logic in `HTTPRequest::GetQueryParameter`?

1. Specifically with regards to the structure of the endpoints, do you see any further improvements
   that could be made?
